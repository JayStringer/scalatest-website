<h1>ScalaTest <em>Plus</em></h1>

<p>
The ScalaTest <em>Plus</em> project aims to define integration libraries between ScalaTest and other libraries, to make it easier to test code using those libraries. The first
such integration library is <a href="/plus/play"><em>ScalaTest + Play</em></a>.
</p>

<p>
Each integration library will depend on a version of ScalaTest as well as a version of the target library. The package name of each ScalaTest <em>Plus</em> library will start
with <code>org.scalatestplus</code>. For example, the package name for <em>ScalaTest + Play</em> is <code>org.scalatestplus.play</code>.
