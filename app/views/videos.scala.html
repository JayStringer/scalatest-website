Comparing Functional Error Handling in Scalaz and Scalactic
https://thenewcircle.com/s/post/1704/comparing_functional_error_handling_in_scalaz_and_scalactic
Northeast Scala Symposium January 30, 2015
In this talk I'll compare and contrast the approaches to functional error handling taken by Scalaz and Scalactic. I'll look at how different opinions on typeclass coherence led to two classes in Scalaz, \/ and Validation, and just one in Scalactic, Or. I'll explain why when it comes to success values, I feel left is right and right is wrong, whereas the Scalazzi think the opposite. I'll show how the libraries use algebraic structures differently. And I'll explore how different opinions on how best to leverage functional programming (FP) in Scala led to different library designs.

<p>
In this talk from the Northeast Scala Symposium on Feb 8, 2013, Bill Venners focuses on how to achieve simplicity
in Scala library, DSL, and application design. It highlights general principles
that can be applied to any programming language, and shows specific techniques that can be used in Scala to "implement" the
general principles. This talk gives you a set of concrete guidelines (which guide the design of ScalaTest and Scalactic) that can help
you manage complexity in your Scala projects.

<em>The guidelines from this talk</em>
<ul>

<li>Make errors impossible, or difficult.</li>

<p>
Tests provide benefits, but also incur costs. Tests can help you achieve and maintain desired levels of software
quality, but they take time (and therefore cost money) to write, compile, and run. They can give you confidence
to perform needed refactoring, but can slow you down during refactors that break many tests. And although they
can help you find bugs, they can't prove the absence of bugs.
</p>

<p>
So how do you maximize the return on your investment in tests? In this talk from the ScalaDays conference on June 17, 2014,
Bill Venners, lead developer of
ScalaTest, tackles this question and give his opinions. You'll come away with a set of specific guidelines
that can help you decide how best to employ testing in your projects.

<em>The guidelines from this talk</em>
<ul>
<li>Think of programming as investing.</li>
<li>Write focused tests with descriptive names.</li>
<li>Beware duplication in tests!</li>
<li>Don't overspecify in tests.</li>
<li>Transform human errors into type errors.</li>
<li>Throw exceptions only at humans, never at code.</li>
<li>Minimize pre-conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>
And on tests versus types:
</p>
<blockquote>
Tests can only find your code not guilty. They can't prove it innocent.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Types can only "prove innocence" to the extent they are tested.

<span style="font-size: 125%"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUjLFPRt2KU">Equality for All</a></span>

<p>
The Java platform defines a notion of universal equality in the equals method of java.lang.Object: because the type of
the parameter passed to equals is java.lang.Object, any object can be compared for equality with any other object. This
allows different types that represent the same (or compatible) concepts to be compared for equality (such as Int and
BigInt, or Vector[Int] and List[Int]), but also allows comparisons to compile that will always fail at runtime (such
as Int and String).
</p>
</p>
In this talk from the Scala by the Bay conference on August 8, 2014, Bill Venners discusses
work in progress on ScalaTest and Scalactic to make equality comparisons in Scala safer.

<p>
In this talk from the ScalaExchange conference on Dec 2, 2013, Bill Venners tells the story of the journey from a design
that leaned towards implicit conversions in ScalaTest 1.0 to one that emphasizes implicit parameters in ScalaTest
and ScalaUtils 2.0.
Using primarily demos in the Scala REPL, Bill shows several use cases and applications of implicit parameters that
will help you understand the tradeoffs between implicit conversions and parameters and how to take advantage of
implicit parameters in your own designs.

<p>
ScalaTest 2.0 is a vast enough forest that it is hard to see all the useful trees. In this talk from the ScalaExchange
conference on Dec 3, 2013, Bill Venners guides you
through ScalaTest 2.0 by pointing out lesser-known features of the testing toolkit that can help you get stuff done. You'll
gain insight into what ScalaTest offers, why ScalaTest is designed the way it is, and how you can get more out of it.
