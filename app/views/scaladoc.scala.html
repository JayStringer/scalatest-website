<p>
Note: Scala 2.8 made major changes to Scaladoc, and in the process unfortunately introduced some very major bugs. These bugs
rendered ScalaTest's extensive Scaladoc documentation very difficult to read. In some cases documentation was simply dropped
from the output. As a result, if you are using ScalaTest 1.2, you may prefer to read the Scaladoc for version 1.1, which has
identical functionality (but was generated with Scaladoc for Scala 2.7.7.) In ScalaTest 1.3, we made some changes to work around
some of the bugs, so it is more readable. However you will likely notice many formatting problems that we were unable to work around.
But in 2.9.0, these bugs were not only fixed, but Scaladoc readability and looks were greatly improved. Because ScalaTest 1.4.1 is
identical in functionality with 1.3, 1.3 users may prefer to use the 1.4.1 Scaladoc.
