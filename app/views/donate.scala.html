<h1>Donate to ScalaTest</h1>

<p>
While ScalaTest is open source and free for anyone to use, there’s a ton of sweat, tears, caffeine, love, and care that goes into it. We don’t have magic elves—just a handful of people who work hard to make it work, day in and day out. You help shape the success of ScalaTest when you contribute pull requests to the project (and for that, we thank you!) but the vast majority of the focused work is done by a handful of people paid by Artima.

You can also help ScalaTest by making a donation:

<p>
In return, we’ll send you a thank-you gift to show you our heartfelt appreciation! Get something for yourself or something for your whole team.
