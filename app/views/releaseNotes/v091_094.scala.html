<h1>ScalaTest Release Notes</h1>

<a name="release18"></a>

<p>
ScalaTest 1.8 is source (but not necessarily binary) compatible with previous releases. To upgrade from 1.7.1 or 1.7.2, you should only
need to do a clean build.
</p>

<p>
This release includes the following enhancements, bug fixes, dependency changes, and deprecations: 
</p>

<p>
<em>Enhancements:</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.path.FunSpec"><code>path.FunSpec</code></a>, a sister trait to <code>org.scalatest.FunSpec</code> that isolates tests by running each test in its own instance of the test class, and for each test, only executing the path leading to that test.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.path.FreeSpec"><code>path.FreeSpec</code></a>, a sister trait to <code>org.scalatest.FreeSpec</code> that isolates tests by running each test in its own instance of the test class, and for each test, only executing the path leading to that test.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.ConfigMapWrapperSuite"><code>ConfigMapWrapperSuite</code></a>, a wrapper <code>Suite</code> that passes an instance of the config map to the constructor of the wrapped <code>Suite</code> when run is invoked.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.Eventually"><code>Eventually</code></a>, which provides an
<code>eventually</code> construct that periodically retries executing a passed by-name parameter until it either succeeds or the configured timeout has been surpassed.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.AsyncAssertions"><code>AsyncAssertions</code></a>, which facilitates performing
assertions outside the main test thread, such as assertions in callback methods that are invoked asynchronously. Trait <code>AsyncAssertions</code> provides a
<code>Waiter</code> class that you can use to orchestrate the inter-thread communication required to perform assertions outside the main test thread, and means
to configure it.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.Timeouts"><code>Timeouts</code></a>, which provides a
<code>failAfter</code> construct that allows you to specify a time limit for an operation passed as a by-name parameter, as well as a way to interrupt it if the operation
exceeds its time limit.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.TimeLimitedTests"><code>TimeLimitedTests</code></a>, which, when mixed into a suite class, establishes a time limit for its tests.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.Interruptor"><code>Interruptor</code></a>, an abstract interface defining a strategy for interrupting an operation after a timeout expires (<code>Interruptor</code>s are used by traits <code>Timeouts</code> and <code>TimeLimitedTests</code>.). Provided four built-in implementations: <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.DoNotInterrupt$"><code>DoNotInterrupt</code></a>, <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.SelectorInterruptor"><code>SelectorInterruptor</code></a>, <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.SocketInterruptor"><code>SocketInterruptor</code></a>, <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.ThreadInterruptor$"><code>ThreadInterruptor</code></a>.</li>
<li>Added an <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.time.package"><code>org.scalatest.time</code></a> package containing class <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.time.Span"><code>Span</code></a>, used to express time spans in ScalaTest (<code>Span</code> is used by several traits in <code>org.scalatest.concurrent</code>), trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.time.SpanSugar"><code>SpanSugar</code></a>, and several other <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.time.package">supporting classes and objects</a>.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.ScaledTimeSpans"><code>ScaledTimeSpans</code></a>, which provides a <code>scaled</code> method that will scale a <code>Span</code> larger or smaller by a <code>Double</code> factor taken from a sister method, <code>spanScaleFactor</code>. Added a <code>-F</code>
argument to <code>Runner</code> for specifying the span scale factor (and corresponding commands for sbt and ant).</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.PatienceConfiguration"><code>PatienceConfiguration</code></a>, which provides methods and classes used to configure timeouts and, where relevant, the interval between retries.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.IntegrationPatience"><code>IntegrationPatience</code></a>, which overrides the implicit <code>PatienceConfig</code> object providing default values appropriate for unit testing (150 millisecond timeout and 15 millisecond interval) with one more appropriate for integration testing (15 second timeout and 150 millisecond interval). </li>
<li>Added trait <code><a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.concurrent.Conductors">Conductors</a></code>, moved a copy of <code>Conductor</code> there,
and made changes so that <code>Conductor</code> is configured in a manner consistent with <code>Eventually</code> and <code>AsyncAssertions</code>.</li>
<li>Moved most exception classes and traits to their own package, <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.exceptions.package"><code>org.scalatest.exceptions</code></a>, and left deprecated type aliases in place of their old names. This change was done to declutter their former homes, so it is easier for users
to focus on the classes and traits they are more likely to use day to day.</li>
<li>Added class <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedDueToTimeoutException"><code>TestFailedDueToTimeoutException</code></a>,
a subclass of <code>TestFailedException</code> thrown by the <code>failAfter</code> method of trait <code>Timeouts</code> if it times out.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.exceptions.TimeoutField"><code>TimeoutField</code></a>, a trait mixed into exceptions
thrown as the result of a timeout.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.exceptions.PayloadField"><code>PayloadField</code></a>, a trait mixed into exceptions
that can carry a payload (an arbitrary object that will be fired in the corresponding ScalaTest event, so it can be consumed by custom reporters). Had to add payload
to the primary constructor of several existing exception types. Left the old form in place as an auxiliary constructor so existing code would continue to work.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.exceptions.ModifiablePayload"><code>ModifiablePayload</code></a>, which indicates a <code>PayloadField</code> exception type can modify its payload.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.Payloads"><code>Payloads</code></a>, which facilitates the inclusion of a payload in a thrown ScalaTest exception, so that payload object can be included in a corresponding ScalaTest event and interpreted by custom reporters.</li>

<li>Added a second parameter to the <code>apply</code> method of trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.Informer"><code>Informer</code></a>,
to facilitate the inclusion of a payload in an <code>InfoProvided</code> event. The parameter has type <code>Option[Any]</code> with a default value of <code>None</code>,
so old code will continute to work.</li>

<li>Gave the <code>withClue</code> construct in <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.Assertions"><code>Assertions</code></a> a result type, so it would pass through any
value in case someone wanted that. Previously it was <code>Unit</code>.</li>
<li>Added trait <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.AppendedClues"><code>AppendedClues</code></a>, which provides an implicit conversion that places a <code>withClue</code> method on <code>Any</code>, enabling clue strings to be placed <em>after</em> a block of code that may throw an exception. This construct
complements the <code>withClue</code> construct provided in trait <code>Assertions</code> that allows clue strings to be placed <em>before</em> a block of code.</li>
<li>Dropped explicit mention of <code>java.awt.AWTError</code> to facilitate running ScalaTest on Android. ScalaTest will continue to treat <code>java.awt.AWTError</code>s
in the same way: they cause the suite to abort rather than the test to fail, but checking is now done based on the string class name to avoid the explicit reference that
caused problems on Android.</li>
<li>Reimplemented the <code>run</code> method in the <code>org.scalatest</code> package object as an <code>apply</code> method in an
<a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.run$"><code>org.scalatest.run</code></a> singleton
object. The client code and behavior are the same, but this implementation enabled the addition of a <code>main</code> method as well that provides the "simple runner".</li>
<li>Added a <em>simple runner</em> implemented as a <code>main</code> method on the new
<a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.run$"><code>org.scalatest.run</code></a> singleton object. This application provides
a better out-of-box experience for users getting started with ScalaTest, and an easier to remember way to run tests from the command line for experienced ScalaTest users.</li>
<li>Added support to ScalaTest for specifying <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.tools.Runner$@@specifyingChosenStyles">chosen
styles</a>, to help enforce uniformity of testing styles on projects built by teams of developers. You can now specify chosen styles with <code>-y</code> argument
to <code>Runner</code>. Added a new lifecycle method to <code>Suite</code>, 
<code>styleName</code> to support this feature. ScalaTest style traits override <code>styleName</code> and return their fully qualified name as a string. If chosen styles is
defined, ScalaTest style traits that are not among the chosen list will abort with a message complaining that the style trait is not one of the chosen styles instead
of running its tests. Chosen styles is also supported by the ScalaTest ant task and <code>ScalaTestFramework</code> (so accessible via sbt). 
</li>
<li>Added ability to specify <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.8")#org.scalatest.tools.Runner$@@specifyingSuffixesToDiscover">suffixes to discover</a>, which
can speed up the discovery process on large projects. If you specify suffixes with <code>-q</code>, ScalaTest will only load and inspect class files whose
name ends in the suffix to see if they are runnable <code>Suite</code>s. Also added a <code>-Q</code> option to specify suffixes <code>"Suite|Spec"</code>.
</li>
<li>Added support for using <code>they</code> as an alternative to <code>it</code> in <code>org.scalatest.FlatSpec</code> and <code>org.scalatest.fixture.FlatSpec</code>, <code>org.scalatest.FunSpec</code>, <code>org.scalatest.fixture.FunSpec</code>, and <code>org.scalatest.path.FunSpec</code>. (This enhancement was inspired by a blog post
by Christoph Henkelmann.)</li>
<li>Tweaked the algorithm used to clean up type names in the Scala interpreter, so users aren't pummeled with dollar signs. The old algorithm was broken when Scala
changed its approach to naming in 2.9. Once again you'll see <code>ExampleSpec</code> rather than <code>$read$$iw$$iw$$iw$$iw$ExampleSpec</code>.</li>
<li>Renamed <code>-c</code> to <code>-P</code>, <code>-r</code> to <code>-C</code>, and <code>-p</code> to <code>-R</code> in <code>Runner</code> and
<code>ScalaTestAntTask</code>, and deprecated the old usages. After the deprecation cycle, will deprecate the capital forms in favor of lower case forms.
The goal is to have <code>-p</code> mean parallel execution (currently <code>-c</code>), <code>-c</code> mean custom reporter (currently <code>-r</code>), and
-r</code> mean runpath (currently <code>-p</code>). The new names will be more consistent and hopefully easier to remember.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<em>Bug fixes</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Fixed stack depth in several style trait methods for rare problems like <code>TestRegistrationClosedException</code>.</li>
<li>Discovered that <code>GeneratorDrivenPropertyChecks</code> were not reporting the given parameter names if they were
specified in combination with explicit generators passed to <code>forAll</code>. Now they do.</li>
<li>Discovered <code>PropertyCheckException</code>s were not correctly modifying their message if used with <code>withClue</code>. Now they do.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Deprecations</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Deprecated <code>org.scalatest.concurrent.Conductor</code> after moving a copy of it to trait <code>Conductors</code>. The purpose of this move was so that
<code>Conductor</code> could be configured via <code>PatienceConfiguration</code> and scaled by <code>ScaledTimeSpans</code>, making it consistent with
traits <code>Eventually</code> and <code>AsyncAssertions</code>. 
<li>Deprecated <code>org.scalatest.concurrent.ConductorMultiFixture</code>, which accidentally escaped deprecation in 1.5 when the other "multi fixture" traits
(in <code>org.scalatest.fixture</code>) were deprecated.</li>
<li>Deprecated <code>org.scalatest.DuplicateTestNameException</code>,  <code>org.scalatest.ModifiableMessage</code>,  <code>org.scalatest.NotAllowedException</code>,  <code>org.scalatest.StackDepth</code>,  <code>org.scalatest.StackDepthException</code>,  <code>org.scalatest.TestFailedException</code>,  <code>org.scalatest.TestPendingException</code>,  <code>org.scalatest.TestRegistrationClosedException</code>,  <code>org.scalatest.prop.DiscardedEvaluationException</code>,  <code>org.scalatest.prop.GeneratorDrivenPropertyCheckFailedException</code>,  <code>org.scalatest.prop.PropertyCheckFailedException</code>,  <code>org.scalatest.prop.TableDrivenPropertyCheckFailedException</code>. These deprecations
were to support moving most exception types to the new <code>org.scalatest.exceptions</code> package. Old code using the old names will continue
to work during the deprecation phase. An <code>org.scalatest.prop</code> package object was created to hold the deprecated type aliases for that package. This
package object will also be removed at the end of the deprecation period (unless it acquires a new, non-deprecated member in the meantime).</li>
<li>Deprecated <code>Runner</code> arguments <code>-r</code>, <code>-c</code>, and <code>-p</code> (and corresponding <code>ScalaTestAntTask</code> syntax)
 in favor of their new names (see the previous Enhancements section).
The old names will continue to work during the deprecation cycle.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Removals</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>REMOVED support in <code>Runner</code> for <code>-t</code> to run TestNG tests. This use of <code>-t</code> was deprecated in 1.7 and replaced by <code>-b</code>,
because in ScalaTest 2.0 <code>-t</code> will be used to indicate a test name to run. To make sure the ground was clear for this new use
in ScalaTest 2.0, <code>-t</code> will print an error message and abort the run in ScalaTest 1.8. If you haven't already, you'll have to change uses of
<code>-t</code> to <code>-b</code> to upgrade to ScalaTest 1.8.</li>
<li>REMOVED the ability to directly instantiate <code>org.scalatest.exceptions.PropertyCheckException</code> by making it abstract. It was supposed
to be abstract, but as an oversight was left concrete. This is a breaking change that likely will not affect any users.</li>
<li>REMOVED the ability to mix most ScalaTest style traits together in the same class by adding <code>styleName</code> method to <code>AbstractSuite</code> and
overriding and making it final in many style traits. It was never intended that users would mix together core style traits, and likely it wouldn't compile in
many cases anyway. But now for sure it won't compile in most cases.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in 1.7.2 (for Scala 2.9.0+ and Scala 2.8.1+)</h2>

<p>
ScalaTest 1.7.2 is identical to 1.7.1 except for two changes: the argument "sequential" is ignored to facilitate Play 2.0 integration and
a bug in the ScalaTest Framework has been fixed. The bug that was fixed was that when running with sbt, ScalaTest would keep a thread going
after the tests were completed. This thread is now not created in the first place.
</p>

<a name="release171"></a>
<h2>Changes in 1.7.1 (for Scala 2.9.0+ and Scala 2.8.1+)</h2>

<p>
ScalaTest 1.7.1 is identical to 1.7 except for one change: the Guice dependency in the pom.xml file has been made optional. This minor
pom file error in 1.7 unfortunately caused a much more serious deployment problem: the wrong jar files were deployed to scala-tools.org (mirrored
on Maven Central) under artifact IDs
scalatest_2.8.2, scalatest_2.9.0-1, and scalatest_2.9.1. The jar files for 1.7.RC2 were incorrectly deployed instead. We redeployed
correct 1.7 jar files over the top as soon as we discovered the problem, but because the incorrect jars escaped and were in the repository for a while
we released 1.7.1 one day later so people can be sure they are getting good jar files from the Maven repositories.
</p>

<p>
To see the changes in 1.7.1 from the previous releases (1.6.1 and 1.5.1), therefore, look at the <a href="#release17">release notes for 1.7</a>.
</p>

<a name="release17"></a>
<h2>Changes in 1.7 (for Scala 2.9.0+ and Scala 2.8.1+)</h2>

<p>
ScalaTest 1.7 is source (but not necessarily binary) compatible with previous releases. To upgrade from 1.5.1 or 1.6.1, you should only
need to do a clean build.
</p>

<p>
This release includes the following enhancements, bug fixes, dependency changes, and deprecations: 
</p>

<p>
<em>Enhancements:</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Added trait <code>Inside</code>, which lets you make assertions about values 
extracted from an object via a pattern match</li>
<li>Added traits <code>OptionValues</code>, <code>EitherValues</code>, and <code>PartialFunctionValues</code>, 
which allow you to make one-liner assertions about values that 
<em>should</em> exist in <code>Option</code>s, <code>Either</code>s, and <code>PartialFunction</code>s</li>
<li>Added extra methods on <code>MockitoSugar</code> for new mock methods added to <code>Mockito</code></li>
<li>Added <code>WrapWith</code> annotation to enable ScalaTest to run non-<code>Suite</code>s, 
similar to JUnit's <code>RunWith</code> annotation</li>
<li>Added trait <code>NonImplicitAssertions</code>, which turns off the lone implicit 
conversion you get by default in a ScalaTest suite</li>
<li>Made <code>Event</code> and <code>Ordinal</code> serializable, as well as internal 
implementations of <code>Rerunner</code>, to make it easier to run tests in a 
different VM across a network</li>
<li>OSGI-enabled ScalaTest's jar file</li>
<li>Added companion objects for <code>EasyMockSugar</code> and <code>MockitoSugar</code>, selfless traits</li>
<li>Improved Scaladoc examples for shared tests, removing dependency on 
test order in the <code>SharedBehaviors</code> traits</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Bug fixes</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Made <code>OneInstancePerTest</code> report tests tagged as ignored as Ignored 
rather than running them. To fix this, had to change the semantics of 
run slightly, but in a way that is unlikely to break any user code. 
Now if you pass the name of a test marked as ignored to <code>Suite.run</code>, the 
test will be reported as ignored. Previously it would be run even 
though it was marked as ignored. So now ignore always means ignore 
(and that is arguably an improvement because it is more consistent). 
The upshot is that if you want to run a test marked as ignored, you 
need to take the ignore annotation off, then run it.</li>
<li>Added a hack to fire a test failed event for a test named <code>"!!! Suite 
Aborted !!!"</code> in the case of a <code>SuiteAborted</code> event when running with 
sbt. Will eventually help enhance sbt's <code>Framework</code> to do this the right 
way, but for now, at least sbt won't think that nothing went wrong.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in <code>GeneratorDrivenPropertyChecks</code>. Previously if you 
supplied generator, name string tuples to <code>forAll</code>, and the property 
check failed, the names you supplied wouldn't show up in the error 
message. Instead the error message would just show generic names 
<code>arg0</code>, <code>arg1,</code> <em>etc.</em> Now it shows the supplied names.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Dependency Changes</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Upgraded EasyMock from 3.0 to 3.1</li>
<li>Upgraded Added a dependency that TestNG needed on Guice 3.0</li>
<li>Upgraded JUnit from 4.4 to 4.10</li>
<li>Upgraded TestNG from 5.7 to 6.3.1. This was the tricky one, because 
some binary incompatible things happened in TestNG between 5.7 and 
6.3.1. We used reflection internally to deal with it dynamically, so 
you should be able to still use older versions of TestNG without 
getting <code>ClassNotFoundErrors</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Deprecations</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Deprecated -t in favor of -b in <code>Runner</code>, for running TestNG test 
suites (-t will still work during deprecation cycle, but you'll get a 
deprecation warning.) 
<li>Deprecated <code>Rerunner</code> with a note asking if anyone is using it. If we 
don't hear back that anyone is using it, there's a good chance we'll 
remove it in 2.0  (<code>Rerunner</code> will still work during deprecation cycle, 
but you'll get a deprecation warning.) 
<li>Deprecated <code>org.scalatest.fixture.FixtureX</code> in favor of 
<code>org.scalatest.fixture.X</code>. So <code>fixture.FixtureWordSpec</code> became 
<code>fixture.WordSpec</code>, <code>fixture.FixtureFunSuite</code> became <code>fixture.FunSuite</code>, 
<em>etc.</em> (The old names will still work during deprecation cycle, but 
you'll get a deprecation warning until you change the names.) 
<li>Deprecated <code>that</code> in favor of <code>which</code> in <code>WordSpec</code> and 
<code>fixture.WordSpec</code> (<code>that</code> will still work during the deprecation cycle, 
but you'll get a deprecation warning until you change uses to <code>which</code>. 
We plan to reuse <code>that</code> for a different purpose in the future.) 
<li>Deprecated <code>org.scalatest.Spec</code> in favor of <code>org.scalatest.FunSpec</code>, and 
<code>org.scalatest.fixture.FixtureSpec</code> in favor of 
<code>org.scalatest.fixture.FunSpec</code>. (The old names will still work during 
the deprecation cycle, but you'll get a deprecation warning. We plan 
to reuse <code>Spec</code> for a different purpose in the future.) 
</ul>

<a name="release161"></a>
<h2>Changes in 1.6.1 (for Scala 2.9.x)</h2>

<p>
1.6.1 includes all the enhancements listed in the ScalaTest 1.5 release notes, plus a few other enhancements relative to 1.5:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Reworked some of the Scaladoc documentation, particularly the documentation on how to use shared fixtures to make clearer the intent
and tradeoffs of each way of doing shared fixtures</li>
<li>Added the <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> trait and deprecated <code>BeforeAndAfterEachFunctions</code> and <code>BeforeAndAfterAllFunctions</code>.
The <code>BeforeAndAfterEach/AllFunctions</code> traits were added in ScalaTest 1.3. They were deprecated for two reasons. One is that the trait names were too long. The other was that <code>BeforeAndAfterEachFunctions</code> has a <code>beforeEach</code> method that takes one parameter, and so does <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code>. If these two traits were mixed together there was an (extremely unlikely) chance you could accidentally invoke the wrong <code>beforeEach</code>. <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> replaces <code>BeforeAndAfterEachFunctions</code>, with <code>before</code> replacing <code>beforeEach</code>. If you used <code>BeforeAndAfterEachFunctions</code>, you can get rid of the deprecation warning by changing your code to use <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> instead. If you used <code>BeforeAndAfterAllFunctions</code>, you can get rid of the deprecation warning by changing your code to use <code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code> instead.
</li>
<li>Deprecated the <code>MultipleFixtureXXX</code> traits in the <code>fixture</code> package.
The <code>MultipleFixtureXXX</code> traits were deprecated because because using explicit conversions to implement multiple fixtures yields more readable code than using implicit conversions. You can continue to use the implicit conversion approach if you wish, of course. To get rid of the deprecation warning, change "<code>MultipleFixtureXXX</code>" to "<code>FixtureXXX with ConfigMapFixture</code>".
</li>
</ul>

<a name="release151"></a>
<h2>Changes in 1.5.1 (for Scala 2.8.1)</h2>

<p>
Version 1.5.1 has the same features as version 1.6.1, but ScalaTest works on Scala 2.8.1+ whereas ScalaTest 1.6.1 works on Scala 2.9.0+.
See the release notes for ScalaTest 1.6.1 for information on the enhancements this release contains on top of ScalaTest 1.5.
</p>

<a name="release15"></a>
<h2>Changes in 1.5 (for Scala 2.8.1)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Changed the method signature of <code>whenExecuting</code> in <code>EasyMockSugar</code> so that it takes a single var arg of mock objects instead of one mock object followed by a second var arg of optional mock objects. The original goal was to make it a compiler error to not pass no mock objects. But a user who had a list of mock objects (say, named <code>mocks</code>) wanted to say <code>whenExecuting(mocks: _*)</code>, and could not. I decided it was better to make that situation easy and just allow the error of passing no mocks to when executing to become a runtime error. Since this method will most likely be called inside test code, that error would simply result in a test failure. This change breaks binary compatibility, but not source code, unless someone was using named parameters in an invocation of <code>whenExecuting</code>, which is unlikely). So a simple recompile should suffice.</li>

<li>Added <code>failedCodeFileName</code> and <code>failedCodeLineNumber</code> methods to the <code>StackDepth</code> trait. These are implemented already, so should be source (and even binary) compatible, unless you have a method of that name already in a custom exception you made that extends <code>StackDepth</code>. Likely no one does.</li>

<li>Added <code>failureOf</code> method in a <code>FailureOf</code> trait. This method executes a passed block of code. If no exception is thrown it returns a <code>None</code>. Else if it is one of the exceptions that normally causes a test to fail in ScalaTest (all but some <code>Error</code> types), it returns that exception wrapped in a <code>Some</code>.</li>

<li>Added <code>TableFor1</code> through <code>TableFor22</code>, which host tables of data on which property checks can be performed. Added a <code>TableDrivenPropertyChecks</code> trait that provides convenient factory methods for creating tables and checking properties against them. Fleshed out a <code>PropertyCheckFailedException</code> hierarchy, adding <code>PropertyCheckFailedException</code> ,<code>TableDrivenPropertyCheckFailedException</code>, and <code>GeneratorDrivenPropertyCheckFailedException</code> (deprecated <code>PropertyTestFailedException</code> in favor of the name <code>GeneratorDrivenPropertyCheckFailedException</code>).</li>

<li>Enhanced the standard out/error reporters, and the reporters used with sbt, so they show truncated stacktraces if available even if the exception contains or is a "cause" exception. Previously if a cause existed, full stack traces were always displayed.</li>

<li>Fixed tiny little display bug which caused "duplicate test name" to show up twice in the error message when duplicate tests were discovered in a <code>FunSuite</code> or <code>FixtureFunSuite</code>.</li>

<li>Made <code>Iterable</code> and <code>Collection</code> into <code>Traversable</code> in ScalaTest matchers. This was the final step in bringing matchers up to date with Scala 2.8. In the process, some classes that implement the matchers DSL were renamed. This will be a breaking change only if someone did something that used those explicit names, which is highly unlikely. For example, the name of implicit conversion <code>convertIterableMatcherToArrayMatcher</code> was changed to <code>convertTraversableMatcherToArrayMatcher</code>. Most people would be using that implicitly, so the name change won't break code. Anyone who just used the ScalaTest matchers DSL, and did not attempt to explicitly use its internals, will only need to recompile. In the process, ScalaTest's matchers became more general. Where before they were only working with <code>Iterables</code>, they now they work with <code>Traversables</code>.</li>

<li>Dropped the <code>Suite</code> self type from <code>Checkers</code>, and made a <code>Checkers</code> companion object that mixes in the <code>Checkers</code> trait: the self-less trait pattern.</li>

<li>Overrode <code>compose</code> on many types that extend function, narrowing the result type to the ScalaTest type.  For example, overrode <code>compose[U]</code> on <code>Matcher[T]</code>, which extends <code>(T => MatchResult)</code>, and narrowed the result type to <code>Matcher[U]</code>. This way when you compose a <code>Matcher</code> and a function, you get a <code>Matcher</code> back. Also did this on <code>BeMatcher</code>, <code>BePropertyMatcher</code>, and <code>HavePropertyMatcher</code>.</li>

<li>Made <code>Informer</code> extend <code>(String => Unit)</code>, the function type it always felt it was at heart.</li>

<li>Added a companion object for <code>Matcher</code> with a factory method that allows you to create a <code>Matcher[T]</code> from a passed function of type <code>(T => MatchResult)</code>.</li>

<li>Added a companion object for <code>BeMatcher</code> with a factory method that allows you to create a <code>BeMatcher[T]</code> from a passed function of type <code>(T => MatchResult)</code>.</li>

<li>Added a companion object for <code>BePropertyMatcher</code> with a factory method that allows you to create a <code>BePropertyMatcher[T]</code> from a passed function of type <code>(T => MatchResult)</code>.</li>

<li>Added a <code>toNoArgTest</code> method to <code>OneArgTest</code>, to make it easier to delegate to an inherited implementation of the form of <code>withFixture</code> that takes a <code>NoArgTest</code>.</li>

<li>Created a <code>Suites</code> class that takes a variable length arg of suites to nest. Made <code>SuperSuite</code> extend this, and deprecated <code>SuperSuite</code>. <code>Suites</code> is a much clearer name, and I'd like to use "<code>SuperSuite</code>" and "<code>SuperSpec</code>" as the suggested name of a trait or class that mixes in your favorite things.</li>

<li>Created a <code>Specs</code> class that performs the same function as <code>Suites</code>, but sounds more BDDish.</li>

<li>Removed <code>org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfter</code> trait, which had been deprecated since 1.0.</li>

<li>Removed <code>groups</code> method from <code>Suite</code>, which had been deprecated since 1.0.</li>

<li>Removed <code>org.scalatest.Group</code> class, which had been deprecated since 1.0.</li>

<li>Removed <code>org.scalatest.Report</code> class, which had been deprecated since 1.0.</li>

<li>Removed <code>org.scalatest.SpecReport</code> class, which had been deprecated since 1.0.</li>

<li>Removed the <code>failedTestCodeStackDepth</code> and <code>failedTestCodeFileNameAndLineNumberString</code> methods from <code>StackDepth</code> and its descendants. These had both been deprecated since 1.0.</li>

<li>Removed trait <code>Rerunnable</code>, which had been deprecated since 1.0.</li>

<li>Removed ScalaTestTask, which had been deprecated since 1.0.</li>

<li>Started requiring <code>TagAnnotation</code> for tagging methods of <code>Suite</code>. As of 1.5 any annotations that aren't themselves annotated with <code>org.scalatest.TagAnnotation</code> will not be interpretted as tags. Interpretting arbitrary annotations as tags had been deprecated since 1.0.</li>

<li>Stop running nested suites in <code>runNestedSuites</code> and tests in <code>runTests</code> after the stopper returns true. The current test or nested suite running when the stop flag is set to true will continue, but will be the last, when running sequentially.  When running tests in parallel, more than one may be currently running, which means more than one may continue to completion before the flag is again checked, after which it will stop. A <code>Stopper</code> is a polite request to stop, so some implementations of <code>Suite</code> may not stop right away once a stop is requested, but prior to this release, most traits in ScalaTest kept right on going after a stop was requested.</li>

<li>Fixed bug whereby passing in a non-existing test name to run on <code>FunSuite</code> and <code>FixtureFunSuite</code> would result in a failed test rather than an <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>.</li>

<li>Insert line breaks where they should be in the GUI reporter's message display. This made <code>PropertyCheckFailedExceptions</code> read more nicely in the GUI Reporter.</li>

<li>Enhanced <code>StackDepthException</code> by adding a new constructor. Moved the formerly primary constructor, which took an <code>Option[String]</code> message, <code>Option[Throwable]</code> cause, and <code>Int</code> <code>failedCodeStackDepth</code>, to be an auxiliary constructor. The new primary constructor takes functions that produce a message and the stack depth. This allows the calculation of these to be delayed. One reason is to avoid doing the processing to find the stack depth an build the string if it is never used, which can happen, for example, during a shrink phase of a failed property check. It also enables the message to include the failed code file name and line number. Also added one other auxiliary constructor, and modified <code>TestFailedException</code>, <code>NotAllowedException</code>, <code>DuplicateTestNameException</code>, <code>TestRegistrationClosedException</code>,  but left the previous primary constructor as an auxiliary contructor in each case, so existing code will not break. (New exceptions <code>PropertyTestFailedException</code>, <code>TableDrivenPropertyTestFailedException</code>, and <code>GeneratorDrivenPropertyTestFailedException</code> also take the same functions.)</li>

<li>Changed the test names in <code>FeatureSpec</code> and <code>FixtureFeatureSpec</code> so they include <code>"Scenario:"</code>. Given this <code>FeatureSpec</code>:

<pre>
class MySpec extends FeatureSpec {
  feature("Remote control mute button") {
    scenario("Mute button pressed when TV not muted") {}
    scenario("Mute button pressed when TV is muted") {}
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
The test names prior to 1.5 would have been:
</p>

<pre>
Feature: Remote control mute button Mute button pressed when TV is muted
Feature: Remote control mute button Mute button pressed when TV not muted
</pre>

<p>
And in 1.5 they are:
</p>

<pre>
Feature: Remote control mute button Scenario: Mute button pressed when TV is muted
Feature: Remote control mute button Scenario: Mute button pressed when TV not muted
</pre>

<p>
This is a breaking change if anyone has written code that depends on those test name strings. It is unlikely anyone has done that, but if so, the fix is to insert <code>"Scenario: "</code> between the feature part and the scenario part of the test name.
</p></li>

<li>Removed four overloaded execute methods on <code>Suite</code> and replaced them with one execute method that takes parameters with default argument values. This will not break source code unless you invoked the overloaded form of execute that takes a config map only. I figure it is unlikely anyone has done that, because config maps are used rarely and execute is likely most often called from an interpreter command not source code. If this does strike you, however, my apologies. The fix is to change this:

<pre>
mySuite.execute(myConfigMap)
</pre>

<p>
to this:
</p>

<pre>
mySuite.execute(configMap = myConfigMap)
</pre>

<p>
At the call site.
</p>

<p>
In addition to <code>testName</code> and <code>configMap</code>, which you could pass to execute prior to 1.5, in 1.5 you can also configure the run with parameters <code>color</code>, <code>durations</code>, <code>shortstacks</code>, <code>fullstacks</code>, and <code>stats</code>. See the Scaladoc documenation for execute for details on these parameters.
</p></li>

<li>Enhanced TDD-style traits so that they send formatted events. Previously only BDD-style traits sent formatted events. This change affects the output of <code>Suite</code>, <code>FunSuite</code>, <code>JUnit3Suite</code>, <code>JUnitSuite</code>, and <code>TestNGSuite</code>.</li>

<li>Enhanced style traits that allow nesting so that the output shows up nested as well. Previously all style traits flattened their output to at most one level of indentation. This change affects the output of <code>Spec</code> and <code>WordSpec</code>.</li>

<li>Previously you could choose between short and full stack traces in reporters that printed strings (such as the standard out reporter). Added an option in 1.5 to show no stack trace for stack depth exceptions, and made this the default. Added a <code>'S'</code> configuration option for reporters that selects short stack traces. This option can be specified to <code>Runner</code>, the ant task, and sbt via the <code>ScalaTestFramework</code> implementation.</li>

<li>Added two new style traits, <code>PropSpec</code> and <code>FreeSpec</code>, including sister traits in the fixture package: <code>FixturePropSpec</code>, <code>FixtureFreeSpec</code>, <code>MultipleFixturePropSpec</code>, and <code>MultipleFixtureFreeSpec</code>.</li>

<li>Severed the inheritance relationship between function types and several of the traits passed to <code>Suite.run</code>. This was done to allow tools vendors to implement these types in Java. This could be a breaking change if a user used any of these types as a function. That is very unlikely, but just in case, also added implicit conversions from each type to the corresponding function type. This affected traits <code>Reporter</code>, <code>Stopper</code>, and <code>Distributor</code>.</li>

<li>Added the <code>org.scalatest.Shell</code> and an <code>org.scalatest</code> package object that implements "the ScalaTest shell," its DSL for the Scala interpreter.</li>

<li>Enhanced sbt integration so that <code>SuiteStarting/Completed/Aborted</code> events are fired. This makes the output when running with sbt consistent with the output when running via the <code>Runner</code> with the standard out reporter. (Mainly, you get the simple name of the suite class at the top, terminated by a colon.)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in 1.4.1 (for Scala 2.9.x)</h2>

<p>
The goal of the 1.4.1 release is to provide a smooth transition to Scala 2.9.0 for ScalaTest users. It is identical
to 1.3 except for changes required to get it to compile as 1.4.1 under Scala 2.9.0, plus one bug fix to the build to ensure
the Java portions are cross-compiled for JDK 1.5.
</p>

<ul>
<li>Changed the ScalaTest 1.3 build file to ensure the parts of ScalaTest 1.4.1 written in Java (only two classes) get cross-compiled
for JDK 1.5. (This bug fix will also soon be released as ScalaTest 1.3.1. Those two Java classes were accidentally
compiled for JDK 1.6 in ScalaTest 1.3.)</li>
<li>Renamed 1.3 to 1.4.1.</li>
<li>Updated the Scala library and compiler to 2.9.0, and the ScalaCheck JAR file to version 1.8 compiled with Scala 2.9.0.</li>
<li>Added the Scala version number to the artifact ID. <em>I.e.</em>, the artifact ID for ScalaTest 1.4.1 is <code>scalatest_2.9.0</code>
instead of plain old <code>scalatest</code>.</li>
<li>Recompiled 1.3 to run under 1.4.1.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Note: What happened to 1.4 you ask? We were given an early access release of Scala 2.9.0, so that ScalaTest could be recompiled for it
early. We quietly deployed 1.4 so that other projects could be built prior to the official announcement that Scala 2.9.0 was ready. We didn't
announce it, but nevertheless someone could have run across it and downloaded it. One day later, we got a brand new Scala 2.9.0. They  had
fixed a couple show-stopper bugs. We needed to redeploy, so we bumped the version number up to 1.4.1 in case someone had found 1.4 in the
meantime. That 1.4 release was then removed from scala-tools.org.
</p>

<a name="release13"></a>
<h2>Changes in 1.3 (for Scala 2.8.x)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Improved the sbt support provided by <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.3")org/scalatest/tools/ScalaTestFramework.html"><code>ScalaTestFramework</code></a> by allowing the formatted
output generated by specification-style traits like <code>Spec</code> or <code>WordSpec</code> to be seen by the
user when running through sbt. Also enable color output.</li> 
<li>Fixed a bug when running suites concurrently that usually manifested itself as an  eventual out of memory error. The
problem was the executor service being used wasn't being shutdown after each use. So if repeated runs were done in the same JVM,
eventually too meany threads would pile up.</li>
<li>Added a <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.3")org/scalatest/SeveredStackTraces.html"><code>SeveredStackTraces</code></a> stack traces trait that violently chops off test-related stack traces just above the 
offending line of test code. Although ScalaTest's exception types provide sufficient information to do this when presenting a
stack trace to the user, some tools (such as IDEs that run ScalaTest via JUnit) don't use this information yet and therefore show
the full stack trace. <code>SeveredStackTraces</code> can be helpful until such tools provide better support for
ScalaTest.</li>
<li>Added traits <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.3")org/scalatest/BeforeAndAfterEachFunctions.html"><code>BeforeAndAfterEachFunctions</code></a> and <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.3")org/scalatest/BeforeAndAfterAllFunctions.html"><code>BeforeAndAfterAllFunctions</code></a>, which offer a more concise form
of before and after functionality (but which can't be stacked or provide access to a config map).</li>
<li>Updated the version of EasyMock to EasyMock 3.0. Unfortuately, EasyMock 3.0 breaks compatibility with previous versions of EasyMock by
moving very important types to new packages. So if you're using EasyMock with ScalaTest, you'll need to upgrade to EasyMock 3.0 to use
ScalaTest 1.3.</li>
<li>Updated the version of ScalaCheck to 1.8. If you're using ScalaTest with ScalaCheck, you'll likely need to upgrade to ScalaCheck 1.8 to use
ScalaTest 1.3.</li>
<li>Added documentation explaining that because <a href="@routes.Application.scaladocs("1.3")org/scalatest/concurrent/Conductor.html"><code>Conductor</code></a> uses the result of calling <code>thread.getState</code> for control flow,
occasionally <code>Conductor</code> can produce incorrect results.</li>
<li>Now only use as tags on <code>Suite</code> annotations that are themselves annotated with <code>org.scalatest.TagAnnotation</code>. This
is a breaking change that was marked as deprecated since 1.0, and the deprecation cycle has ended.</li>
<li>Added <code>withClue</code> to <code>Assertions</code> to provide a way to supply extra information in an exception thrown by <code>intercept</code>
or a ScalaTest matcher expression.</li>
<li>Made <code>assert(a1 === a2)</code> compare arrays structurally. In matcher expressions, the <code>===</code> operator means equality in terms
of invoking <code>==</code>, except for arrays, for which <code>==</code> checks that the two arrays are the same instance. For arrays, ScalaTest 
matchers passes the two arrays to <code>java.util.Arrays.deepEquals</code>. Now <code>===</code> has the same behavior for arrays when used in
an assertion. As a result, the <code>===</code> operator now always compares arrays structurally no matter how it is used in ScalaTest. Note, this
change would break any code that was intentionally using <code>===</code> to ensure two arrays are the same instance in an <code>assert</code>. It is 
likely no one was actually doing that, but if so, this will show up as a failed test and that code will need to be
changed to <code>assert(a1 eq a2)</code>. (Sorry, there was no way to deprecate a particular use of <code>===</code>.)</li>
</ul>

<a name="release11and12"></a>
<h2>Changes in 1.1 (for Scala 2.7.x) and 1.2 (for Scala 2.8.x)</h2>

<p>
Note: ScalaTest 1.1 and 1.2 basically have identical feature sets. The only difference is the Scala version they support. ScalaTest 1.1 works with Scala 2.7,
and ScalaTest 1.2 with Scala 2.8. For a while we will support both 2.7 and 2.8 with new enhancements, with corresponding ScalaTest 1.1.x and 1.2.x releases.
At some point we'll bump up to 1.3 and only support Scala 2.8 and beyond.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The main change from 1.0 to 1.1/1.2 is many changes to support Scala 2.8. Many of these changes went into both 1.1 and 1.2 codebases to
simplify supporting both codebases in future releases. Some changes went just to the 1.2 branch. None of these should be visible 
to users of ScalaTest. In other words, the ScalaTest API did not need to change between Scala 2.7 and Scala 2.8, only its implementation.</li>
<li>Added <code>dir</code> attribute to ScalaTest ant task.</li>
<li>Renamed XML reporter to <code>junitxml</code> in the ScalaTest ant task.</li>
<li>Made <code>Tag</code> a concrete class (in earlier releases it was abstract), and added a <code>Tag</code> companion object with an <code>apply</code> method. The
abstract <code>Tag</code> class enabled users to define tags with <code>object SlowTest extends Tag("SlowTest")</code>. This enhancements allows
tags to also be created on the fly, for example, with <code>Tag("SlowTest")</code>.</li>
<li>Added <code>ScalaTestFramework</code> to support sbt.</li>
<li>Fixed "smiley-face" bug in XML reporter, an extra few characters that caused the XML to be invalid.</li>
<li>When running failed or ignored tests in WordSpec, print the "should" verb in the GUI report, which was missing.</li>
</ul>

<a name="release10"></a>
<h2>Changes in 1.0 (for Scala 2.7.x)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Dropped <code>ImpSuite</code>, which had been deprecated for two releases</li>
<li>Changed <code>JUnit3Suite</code> so it delegates to JUnit 4's <code>JUnitCore</code> class to run the tests. Before it was simulating JUnit execution without 
actually using JUnit.</li>
<li>Dropped two forms of <code>intercept</code>, which had been deprecated for two releases</li>
<li>Made <code>Distributor</code> into a function (breaking change).</li>
<li>Made <code>Stopper</code> into a function (breaking change).</li>
<li>Renamed <code>Rerunnable</code> into <code>Rerunner</code> and made it a function. Deprecated <code>Rerunnable</code> (breaking change).</li>
<li>Renamed main <code>execute</code> method (the one with many parameters) in <code>Suite</code> to <code>run</code>. Changed its signature (breaking change).</li>
<li>Added two more final <code>execute</code> methods to <code>Suite</code> that each take a <code>configMap</code></li>
<li>Added a sealed hierarcy of <code>Event</code> classes.</li>
<li>Refactored <code>Reporter</code> so that instead of having one method per event type, it has one <code>apply</code> method, which takes an <code>Event</code> (breaking change).</li>
<li>Added <code>ResourcefulReporter</code>, which models a <code>Reporter</code> that holds finite, non-memory resources.</li>
<li>Added <code>Ordinal</code>. Every <code>Event</code> class includes an <code>Ordinal</code> so that the events of parallel runs can be sorted
in sequential order. Made changes to all <code>Suite</code> traits to ensure they fire events with proper <code>Ordinal</code>s.</li>
<li>Added <code>Tracker</code> to support the inclusion of good <code>Ordinal</code>s in fired <code>Event</code>s.</li>
<li>Added <code>Filter</code>, which changes how tags to include and exclude are handled. Previously the two include and exclude sets were passed into
<code>Suite</code> methods, and it was the responsibility of those methods to filter tests correctly. Now the two include and exclude sets are passed to a <code>Filter</code>,
and the <code>Filter</code> is passed to the <code>Suite</code> methods, which can delegate to <code>Filter</code> to do the filtering.</li>
<li>Renamed <code>groups</code> to <code>tags</code> (deprecated <code>groups</code>)</li>
<li>Greatly improved JUnit integration. Added <code>JUnitSuite</code>, <code>JUnitRunner</code>, <code>JUnitWrapperSuite</code>, <code>AssertionsForJUnit</code>, <code>ShouldMatchersForJUnit</code>, <code>MustMatchersForJUnit</code>, <code>JUnitTestFailedError</code></li>
<li>Added -j option to <code>Runner</code> to run JUnit tests with the <code>JUnitWrapperSuite</code></li>
<li>Changed the configuration parameters for <code>Reporters</code>. The old ones will be accepted but have no effect for a two-release deprecation
cycle, after which they will cause <code>Runner</code> to halt with an error message.</li>
<li>Added optional color output to standard out, standard error, and file reporters.</li>
<li>Added <code>Reporter</code> configuration parameters for turning off color, showing durations, and showing full stack traces.</li>
<li>Added a <code>jvmargs</code> option to the Ant task, which makes it possible to pass args to the underlying JVM (important if you need more memory)</li>
<li>Added a <code>fork</code> option to the Ant task, which makes it possible to run ScalaTest in a separate JVM from Ant (also useful for dealing with memory problems).</li>
<li>Renamed <code>goodies</code> to <code>configMap</code>.</li>
<li>Renamed the Ant task from <code>ScalaTestTask</code> to <code>ScalaTestAntTask</code>. Deprecated <code>ScalaTestTask</code>.</li>
<li>Added ability to specify the number of threads to use when running tests in parallel, in both <code>Runner</code> and the Ant task.</li>
<li>Enhanced <code>Runner</code> so that it treats a backslash followed by a space as a literal space in a runpath element, rather than a space separating two
runpath elements. This was necessary to allow people to include pathnames in the runpath that included spaces.</li>
<li>Added two new forms to matchers DSL: <code>result should be === 7</code> and <code>evaluating { "hi".charAt(-1) } should produce [StringIndexOutOfBoundsException]</code>.</li>
<li>Added support for pending tests.</li>
<li>Added <code>pendingUntilFixed</code> method to <code>Suite</code>.</li>
<li>Deprecated <code>Report</code> and <code>SpecReport</code>. These are no longer used, as they were made obsolete by the <code>Reporter</code> refactor. Instead
of <code>SpecReport</code>, the <code>Formatter</code> and its two subclasses, <code>MotionToSuppress</code> and <code>IndentedText</code> are used to format 
specification-style output.</li>
<li>Added the <code>org.scalatest.concurrent</code> package, which includes <code>Conductor</code>, <code>ConductorFixture</code>, <code>ConductorMultiFixture</code>,
and <code>ConductorMethods</code>.</li>
<li>Added the <code>org.scalatest.mock</code> package, which includes <code>EasyMockSugar</code>, <code>JMockCycle</code>, <code>JMockCycleFixture</code>, <code>JMockExpectations</code>, and <code>MockitoSugar</code>.</li>
<li>Added three new BDD traits: <code>WordSpec</code>, <code>FlatSpec</code>, and <code>FeatureSpec</code>.</li>
<li>Added the <code>org.scalatest.fixture</code> package, which includes <code>FixtureSuite</code>, <code>FixtureFunSuite</code>, <code>FixtureSpec</code>, <code>FixtureWordSpec</code>, <code>FixtureFlatSpec</code>, <code>FixtureFeatureSpec</code>, <code>ConfigMapFixture</code>, <code>MultipleFixtureFunSuite</code>, <code>MultipleFixtureSpec</code>, <code>MultipleFixtureWordSpec</code>, <code>MultipleFixtureFlatSpec</code>, and <code>MultipleFixtureFeatureSpec</code>.</li>
<li>Added the <code>org.scalatest.verb</code> package to support <code>FlatSpec</code> and <code>WordSpec</code>.</li>
<li>Split the <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> trait into <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> and <code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code>. Deprecated <code>BeforeAndAfter</code>.</li>
<li>Added trait <code>GivenWhenThen</code>.</li>
<li>Renamed <code>Group</code> to <code>Tag</code>. Deprecated <code>Group</code>. Also renamed <code>groups</code> method to <code>tags</code> in <code>Suite</code>,
and deprecated <code>groups</code>.</li>
<li>Added <code>TagAnnotation</code> to serve as base class for tag annotations for <code>Suite</code>, however, won't enforce for a two-release deprecation cycle
that tag annotations used on <code>Suite</code> test methods need to extend <code>TagAnnotation</code>.</li>
<li>Dropped the <code>apply</code> method that takes a <code>Report</code> (which is no longer used) from <code>Informer</code>, and also dropped
the <code>nameForReport</code> method (breaking changes).</li>
<li>Added the <code>OneInstancePerTest</code> trait.</li>
<li>Added the <code>ParallelTestExecution</code> trait.</li>
<li>Added the <code>SequentialNestedSuiteExecution</code> trait.</li>
<li>Refactored <code>TestFailedException</code> so that it extends <code>StackDepthException</code>, which mixes in <code>StackDepth</code>. Added other
<code>StackDepthExceptions</code> so that other errors in test code beyond just assertion failures will be reported with stack depths:
<code>DuplicateTestNameException</code>, <code>NotAllowedException</code>, and <code>TestRegistrationClosedException</code>. Set aside <code>StackDepth</code>
as a separate trait to support <code>JUnitTestFailedError</code>.</li>
<li>Renamed <code>ExecuteAndRun</code> to <code>AbstractSuite</code>, and added more methods to it, to facilitate the stackable trait pattern (breaking change).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in 0.9.5</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added <code>ShouldMatchers</code> and <code>MustMatchers</code> traits, plus many supporting classes
and traits.</li>
<li>Added support for <code>SpecReport</code> in the GUI, so that <code>SpecReport</code>s get displayed in
a specification style. This makes <code>org.scalatest.Spec</code> output look nicer in the GUI,
and also makes it possible for <code>org.specs.Specification</code> to send <code>SpecReport</code>s that will
look nice in the ScalaTest GUI.</li>
<li>Enhanced the GUI to automatically select the first error, if there is one. This saves users a 
bit of time each error.</li>
<li>Added a <code>TestFailedException</code>, which allows a stack trace depth to be sent along with
test failures. This allows reports to highlight the exactly filename and line number at which a test 
failed. This makes it quicker for users to find the cause of the problem. Enhanced everything to
send <code>TestFailedException</code>s where possible.</li>
<li>Formatted the details area of the GUI so that it is easier to read, including making bold the
most important part of the report, the report message and filename and line number, if it exists.</li>
<li>Made sure the entire stack trace is printed in the GUI's detail area. Previously it might say things like 
37 more... </li>
<li>Made the GUI report list scroll during a rerun, to make it easier to find the reports of
the rerun.</li>
<li>Filled in the name in run completed reports, which was missing.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented suites from being automatically discovered inside JAR files.</li>
<li>Added the exception that caused a ScalaCheck failure as the cause in the <code>TestFailedException</code>,
which was not being propagated to the reporters before.</li>
<li>Display more nicely the information, arguments and labels, provided with a failed ScalaCheck
property check.</li>
<li>In some cases, <code>FunSuite</code> and <code>Spec</code> were not sending <code>Rerunnable</code>s in 
reports even though they could, which made rerunning not work in some cases in the GUI. They now send
a <code>Rerunnable</code> whenever they can.</li>
<li>Removed <code>SpecDasher</code> from the API, which also is no longer mixed in by <code>Spec</code>.
The only reason this was included in 0.9.4 was that it was demonstrated in <em>Programming in
Scala</em>. It still works and can be used, so if you liked it, you can just grab it from
0.9.4 and mix it in yourself as a local mix in.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in 0.9.4</h2>

<ul>
<li>Renamed trait <code>ImpSuite</code> to <code>BeforeAndAfter</code>. <code>ImpSuite</code> remains for now but is marked as deprecated. In
a future release of ScalaTest <code>ImpSuite</code> will be dropped, so please rename your uses of <code>ImpSuite</code> to <code>BeforeAndAfter</code>
as soon as convenient. The reason this was changed is that the "Imp" stood for imperative, because the trait facilitates an imperative style
of testing. Also "imp" in English means "little devil," which projected a good attitude, because one goal of ScalaTest is to encourage users to adopt
a more functional style for fixture "setup" and "teardown." But it's a bit too cute and its meaning not obvious enough from its name. Plus mixing
an <code>ImpSuite</code> into a <code>Spec</code> felt like mixing metaphors.</li>
<li>Pulled the triple equals operator mechanism and the <code>expect</code> and <code>intercept</code> constructs from <code>Suite</code>
into their own trait, named <code>Assertions</code>. <code>Suite</code> now mixes in this trait, so that it has the same functionality as
before. The main reason this was done was so that these constructs could more easily be used outside of ScalaTest <code>Suite</code>s, and also
so the trait could be extended by ScalaTest's matchers. (ScalaTest's matchers are not yet released, but will probably make their debut in
ScalaTest version 0.9.5.) This allows ScalaTest's matchers to assume these constructs exist, and makes it easier to use ScalaTest matchers
independently from ScalaTest <code>Suite</code>s.</li>
<li>Added a version of <code>intercept</code> that takes an implicit <code>Manifest</code>, so that you need not explicitly pass
a class instance anymore. Thus, instead of saying this:

<pre class="indent">
intercept(classOf[StringIndexOutOfBoundsException]) {
  "hi".charAt(-1)
}
</pre>

You can write:

<pre class="indent">
intercept[StringIndexOutOfBoundsException] {
  "hi".charAt(-1)
}
</pre>

The old style that requires an explicit class instance are still in the API, but they are deprecated. They will be removed in some future
release of ScalaTest, so please start migrating to the new style. There are a few corner cases where the new form can't be used, which
are caused by overloading ambiguities with the old style. The two corners are passing an explicit <code>null</code> to intercept and throwing
an explicit exception such that the inferred type of the by-name parameter is <code>Nothing</code>. It is unlikely anyone would do that
anyway, and these two issues will resolve themselves once the deprecated old-style <code>intercept</code> methods are removed.
</li>
<li>Added <code>Spec</code>. This trait is inspired by Ruby's RSpec BDD tool.</li>
<li>Renamed <code>PropSuite</code> to <code>FunSuite</code> in <code>org.scalatest.prop</code>. This was done because it made sense
to add the extra ScalaCheck methods to <code>Spec</code> as well, so it seemed
more reasonable to just have traits with the same name in two different packages. So there would be a <code>FunSuite</code> and <code>Spec</code>
in both <code>org.scalatest</code> and <code>org.scalatest.prop</code>. The latter batch would already mix
in <code>Checkers</code> and offer the extra ScalaCheck property-taking methods, and of course, have a dependency on ScalaCheck. Thus, 
<code>PropSuite</code> was deprecated, but it is left in the API for the time being to avoid client code breakage. <code>PropSuite</code>
 will go away in a future release. Later, the traits that had the extra property-taking methods were judged not worth their weight, so
ScalaTest 0.9.4 does not include a <code>Spec</code> in package <code>org.scalatest.prop</code>.
However because an example using <code>org.scalatest.prop.FunSuite</code> was included in <a href="http://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala"><em>Programming in Scala</em></a>, it was included
in 0.9.4, already deprecated. Both <code>PropSuite</code> and <code>FunSuite</code> will be removed from the <code>org.scalatest.prop</code>
package in a future ScalaTest release, so please start migrating to use <code>org.scalatest.FunSuite</code>, mixing in <code>Checkers</code>
and passing properties to ScalaCheck with <code>check</code>, as shown in <a href="#checkers-example">this example</a>.</li>
<li>Released <code>SpecDasher</code> trait. This may or may not be a good idea, but 
an example of the "dashes" style it enables was shown in <em>Programming in Scala</em>, so it was included in 0.9.4, but deprecated. It may stay or go in
a future release, depending on user feedback. Currently, <code>Spec</code> already mixes <code>SpecDasher</code> in by default, but if
it ends up staying in the API, this connection will almost certainly be severed so that users must explicitly mix it in to get the "dashes" style.
So use it with caution, but even if it is removed, if you like it you can always just add the code for it to your own project and
use it that way.</li>
<li>Added <code>SpecReport</code>, a subclass of <code>Report</code>. <code>Spec</code>s emit <code>SpecReports</code> when they run, and
the print reporters (standard out, err, file, etc.) recognize them and generate specification-like output. In this release the graphic
reporter does not handle <code>SpecReport</code>'s specially, so the output looks like regular test output. In a future release the graphic
reporter will generate a specification-like output. One use case for <code>SpecReport</code>s is integration with Eric Torreborre's specs
tool, however one piece still remains for that integration. Specs (and JUnit and TestNG) generate nested test output, whereas ScalaTest's
model is flat. In a future version ScalaTest's <code>Report</code> class will be enhanced to support nested reports. This will enable
specs tests run through ScalaTest to provide nice nested, specification-like reports.</li>
<li>Created an <code>ExecuteAndRun</code> trait. The purpose of this trait is to pull out abstract method signatures for <code>execute</code> and
<code>runTest</code> (and later if it turns out to be useful, <code>runNestedSuites</code> and <code>runTests</code>) so they can be
called by traits that have <code>Suite</code> as their self type, but extend <code>ExecuteAndRun</code> not <code>Suite</code>, such
as <code>BeforeAndAfter</code>. This makes such traits stackable behaviors that can be mixed into a <code>Suite</code> while not
being a <code>Suite</code> themselves.</li>
<li>Removed <code>testWithInformer</code> and <code>ignoreWithInformer</code> methods from <code>FunSuite</code>, because they were
simply too ugly to live. Unfortunately these were not deprecated, so if you used them you'll need to already make an adjustment to upgrade
to 0.9.4. What replaced them is an imperative approach, which while more error prone will work fine unless abused, and makes
for much nicer client code. There's a new method named <code>info</code> in <code>FunSuite</code>, which returns an <code>Informer</code>.
So where before you said:

<pre class="indent">
testWithInformer("test name") {
  info => {
    info("send info to the reporter")
  }
}
</pre>

Now you'll just say:

<pre class="indent">
test("test name") {
  info("send info to the reporter")
}
</pre>

During suite execution, the <code>info</code> method returns an <code>Informer</code> that immediately forwards information passed to its <code>apply</code>
methods to the reporter. During construction of the object, the <code>info</code> method returns an <code>Informer</code> that saves the information
passed to its <code>apply</code> methods for later sending to the reporter when the suite is executed. At any other time, the <code>info</code>
method will return an <code>Informer</code> that throws an exception.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in 0.9.3</h2>

<ul>
<li>Moved <code>FunSuite</code> from the <code>org.scalatest.fun</code> to <code>org.scalatest</code> package.</li>
<li>Dropped <code>FunSuite1</code> through <code>FunSuite9</code>, which were also in the <code>org.scalatest.fun</code> package, because the surface area
they added to the API didn't seem worth the small savings in code size over creating "with" methods with meaningful
names and explicitly calling them.</li>
<li>Added an <code>ImpSuite</code>, which can be mixed into another suite to gain methods that will run before and after each suite and test.</li>
<li>Updated the portions of Scaladoc comments for <code>Suite</code> and <code>FunSuite</code> that discuss mutable fixtures. Dropped
the suggestion to override <code>runTest</code>, which still works but is verbose, and instead recommended defining and explicitly calling "create" methods or
"with" methods from tests that need the mutable fixtures, or mixing in <code>ImpSuite</code> and using <code>beforeEach</code>, <code>afterEach</code>, etc.</li>
<li>Added an <code>Informer</code> trait, which provides a simpler way to send information to the <code>infoProvided</code>
method of a <code>Reporter</code>.</li>
<li>Changed <code>Suite</code> such that instead of being able to define test methods that take a <code>Reporter</code>, you can define
test methods that take an <code>Informer</code>. Replaced the section of scaladoc for <code>Suite</code> that used to explain how to 
use a passed-in <code>Reporter</code> to now show how to use an <code>Informer</code>.</li>
<li>Changed <code>FunSuite</code> such that instead of being able to register tests whose function values take a <code>Reporter</code>, you can register
tests whose function values take an <code>Informer</code>. Changed the names of the registration methods from <code>test/ignoreWithReporter</code> to
<code>test/ignoreWithInformer</code>. Replaced the section of scaladoc for <code>FunSuite</code> that used to explain how to 
use a <code>Reporter</code> passed in to a test function to now show how to use an <code>Informer</code>.</li>
<li>Moved <code>org.scalatest.scalacheck.CheckSuite</code> to <code>org.scalatest.prop.Checkers</code>, and renamed its <code>checkProperty</code>
methods to plain old <code>check</code>.</li>
<li>Added <code>PropSuite</code>, a subtrait of <code>FunSuite</code>, which offers methods that register tests composed of a single property check.</li>
<li>Improved the messages generated by the <code>assert(... === ...)</code> and <code>expect(...){...}</code> methods. Strings are now reported surrounded
by double quotes, with ends truncated where matching if very long, and with square brackets surrounding the portions that differ. Characters are reported
surrounded by single quotes, integer and floating point numbers as is, and any other object's <code>toString</code> result surrounded by angle brackets.</li>
<li>Removed dollar signs and non-essential text from suite and test names in reports when running from the interpreter.</li>
<li>Improved the look of the output generated by the build-in reporters that print to the standard out, error, or to files.</li>
<li>Added a section to <code>Suite</code>'s scaladoc that describes using external assertions, such as JUnit's assertions, Hamcrest
matchers, or specs matchers, in ScalaTest tests.</li>
<li>Improved the failure message when a ScalaCheck property check fails.</li>
<li>Renamed user-defined properties to "goodies," because the term "properties" was overloaded to mean both key-value pairs that can be passed to suites
and ScalaCheck-like properties. "Goodies" is not a very obvious name, so suggestions for improvement are welcome.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in 0.9.2</h2>

<ul>
<li>Moved <code>Runner</code> from <code>org.scalatest</code> to <code>org.scalatest.tools</code> package.</li>
<li>Added JUnit integration classes in package <code>org.scalatest.junit</code>.</li>
<li>Added TestNG integration classes in package <code>org.scalatest.testng</code>.</li>
<li>Added ScalaCheck integration classes in package <code>org.scalatest.scalacheck</code>.</li>
<li>Added <code>FunSuite</code> family of traits in package <code>org.scalatest.fun</code>.</li>
<li>Added an Ant task.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in 0.9.1</h2>

<ul>
<li>Changed <code>testGroups</code> method name to <code>groups</code>.</li>
<li>Changed operand names of <code>===</code>, from <code>expected === actual</code> to <code>left === right</code>.</li>
<li>Changed message generated from <code>2 === 1</code>, from <code>"Expected 1, but got 2"</code> to <code>"2 did not equal 1"</code>.</li>
<li>Changed <code>expect</code> method name to <code>intercept</code>.</li>
<li>Dropped <code>expectNPE</code> and <code>expectIAE</code> methods.</li>
<li>Added a different <code>expect</code> method, which takes an expected and actual value. <code>expect(1) {2}</code> would generate
the error message <code>"Expected 1, but got 2</code>.</li>
<li>Made versions of <code>expect</code> and <code>intercept</code> that take a <code>message</code>.</li>
<li>Implemented a <code>Suite</code> discovery mechanism in <code>Runner</code>, accessed via <code>-m</code> or <code>-w</code>
command-line arguments.</li>
<li>Dropped <code>!==</code> method from the great <code>Equalizer</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known issues</h2>

<ol>
<li>Reloading classes from JAR files between runs in the GUI doesn't work, because URLClassLoader uses a JAR cache. For now, you'll have to restart the app to pick
up new classes in JAR files. But a better alternative is to simply point ScalaTest to the build directory containing .class files produced by the Scala and
Java compiler. URLClassLoader will not cache these files, so changes to them will be picked up each time you press the Run or Rerun buttons.</li>
</ol>
