<h1>ScalaTest Release Notes</h1>

<h2>Changes in 0.9.5</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added <code>ShouldMatchers</code> and <code>MustMatchers</code> traits, plus many supporting classes
and traits.</li>
<li>Added support for <code>SpecReport</code> in the GUI, so that <code>SpecReport</code>s get displayed in
a specification style. This makes <code>org.scalatest.Spec</code> output look nicer in the GUI,
and also makes it possible for <code>org.specs.Specification</code> to send <code>SpecReport</code>s that will
look nice in the ScalaTest GUI.</li>
<li>Enhanced the GUI to automatically select the first error, if there is one. This saves users a 
bit of time each error.</li>
<li>Added a <code>TestFailedException</code>, which allows a stack trace depth to be sent along with
test failures. This allows reports to highlight the exactly filename and line number at which a test 
failed. This makes it quicker for users to find the cause of the problem. Enhanced everything to
send <code>TestFailedException</code>s where possible.</li>
<li>Formatted the details area of the GUI so that it is easier to read, including making bold the
most important part of the report, the report message and filename and line number, if it exists.</li>
<li>Made sure the entire stack trace is printed in the GUI's detail area. Previously it might say things like 
37 more... </li>
<li>Made the GUI report list scroll during a rerun, to make it easier to find the reports of
the rerun.</li>
<li>Filled in the name in run completed reports, which was missing.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that prevented suites from being automatically discovered inside JAR files.</li>
<li>Added the exception that caused a ScalaCheck failure as the cause in the <code>TestFailedException</code>,
which was not being propagated to the reporters before.</li>
<li>Display more nicely the information, arguments and labels, provided with a failed ScalaCheck
property check.</li>
<li>In some cases, <code>FunSuite</code> and <code>Spec</code> were not sending <code>Rerunnable</code>s in 
reports even though they could, which made rerunning not work in some cases in the GUI. They now send
a <code>Rerunnable</code> whenever they can.</li>
<li>Removed <code>SpecDasher</code> from the API, which also is no longer mixed in by <code>Spec</code>.
The only reason this was included in 0.9.4 was that it was demonstrated in <em>Programming in
Scala</em>. It still works and can be used, so if you liked it, you can just grab it from
0.9.4 and mix it in yourself as a local mix in.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in 0.9.4</h2>

<ul>
<li>Renamed trait <code>ImpSuite</code> to <code>BeforeAndAfter</code>. <code>ImpSuite</code> remains for now but is marked as deprecated. In
a future release of ScalaTest <code>ImpSuite</code> will be dropped, so please rename your uses of <code>ImpSuite</code> to <code>BeforeAndAfter</code>
as soon as convenient. The reason this was changed is that the "Imp" stood for imperative, because the trait facilitates an imperative style
of testing. Also "imp" in English means "little devil," which projected a good attitude, because one goal of ScalaTest is to encourage users to adopt
a more functional style for fixture "setup" and "teardown." But it's a bit too cute and its meaning not obvious enough from its name. Plus mixing
an <code>ImpSuite</code> into a <code>Spec</code> felt like mixing metaphors.</li>
<li>Pulled the triple equals operator mechanism and the <code>expect</code> and <code>intercept</code> constructs from <code>Suite</code>
into their own trait, named <code>Assertions</code>. <code>Suite</code> now mixes in this trait, so that it has the same functionality as
before. The main reason this was done was so that these constructs could more easily be used outside of ScalaTest <code>Suite</code>s, and also
so the trait could be extended by ScalaTest's matchers. (ScalaTest's matchers are not yet released, but will probably make their debut in
ScalaTest version 0.9.5.) This allows ScalaTest's matchers to assume these constructs exist, and makes it easier to use ScalaTest matchers
independently from ScalaTest <code>Suite</code>s.</li>
<li>Added a version of <code>intercept</code> that takes an implicit <code>Manifest</code>, so that you need not explicitly pass
a class instance anymore. Thus, instead of saying this:

<pre class="indent">
intercept(classOf[StringIndexOutOfBoundsException]) {
  "hi".charAt(-1)
}
</pre>

You can write:

<pre class="indent">
intercept[StringIndexOutOfBoundsException] {
  "hi".charAt(-1)
}
</pre>

The old style that requires an explicit class instance are still in the API, but they are deprecated. They will be removed in some future
release of ScalaTest, so please start migrating to the new style. There are a few corner cases where the new form can't be used, which
are caused by overloading ambiguities with the old style. The two corners are passing an explicit <code>null</code> to intercept and throwing
an explicit exception such that the inferred type of the by-name parameter is <code>Nothing</code>. It is unlikely anyone would do that
anyway, and these two issues will resolve themselves once the deprecated old-style <code>intercept</code> methods are removed.
</li>
<li>Added <code>Spec</code>. This trait is inspired by Ruby's RSpec BDD tool.</li>
<li>Renamed <code>PropSuite</code> to <code>FunSuite</code> in <code>org.scalatest.prop</code>. This was done because it made sense
to add the extra ScalaCheck methods to <code>Spec</code> as well, so it seemed
more reasonable to just have traits with the same name in two different packages. So there would be a <code>FunSuite</code> and <code>Spec</code>
in both <code>org.scalatest</code> and <code>org.scalatest.prop</code>. The latter batch would already mix
in <code>Checkers</code> and offer the extra ScalaCheck property-taking methods, and of course, have a dependency on ScalaCheck. Thus, 
<code>PropSuite</code> was deprecated, but it is left in the API for the time being to avoid client code breakage. <code>PropSuite</code>
 will go away in a future release. Later, the traits that had the extra property-taking methods were judged not worth their weight, so
ScalaTest 0.9.4 does not include a <code>Spec</code> in package <code>org.scalatest.prop</code>.
However because an example using <code>org.scalatest.prop.FunSuite</code> was included in <a href="http://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala"><em>Programming in Scala</em></a>, it was included
in 0.9.4, already deprecated. Both <code>PropSuite</code> and <code>FunSuite</code> will be removed from the <code>org.scalatest.prop</code>
package in a future ScalaTest release, so please start migrating to use <code>org.scalatest.FunSuite</code>, mixing in <code>Checkers</code>
and passing properties to ScalaCheck with <code>check</code>, as shown in <a href="#checkers-example">this example</a>.</li>
<li>Released <code>SpecDasher</code> trait. This may or may not be a good idea, but 
an example of the "dashes" style it enables was shown in <em>Programming in Scala</em>, so it was included in 0.9.4, but deprecated. It may stay or go in
a future release, depending on user feedback. Currently, <code>Spec</code> already mixes <code>SpecDasher</code> in by default, but if
it ends up staying in the API, this connection will almost certainly be severed so that users must explicitly mix it in to get the "dashes" style.
So use it with caution, but even if it is removed, if you like it you can always just add the code for it to your own project and
use it that way.</li>
<li>Added <code>SpecReport</code>, a subclass of <code>Report</code>. <code>Spec</code>s emit <code>SpecReports</code> when they run, and
the print reporters (standard out, err, file, etc.) recognize them and generate specification-like output. In this release the graphic
reporter does not handle <code>SpecReport</code>'s specially, so the output looks like regular test output. In a future release the graphic
reporter will generate a specification-like output. One use case for <code>SpecReport</code>s is integration with Eric Torreborre's specs
tool, however one piece still remains for that integration. Specs (and JUnit and TestNG) generate nested test output, whereas ScalaTest's
model is flat. In a future version ScalaTest's <code>Report</code> class will be enhanced to support nested reports. This will enable
specs tests run through ScalaTest to provide nice nested, specification-like reports.</li>
<li>Created an <code>ExecuteAndRun</code> trait. The purpose of this trait is to pull out abstract method signatures for <code>execute</code> and
<code>runTest</code> (and later if it turns out to be useful, <code>runNestedSuites</code> and <code>runTests</code>) so they can be
called by traits that have <code>Suite</code> as their self type, but extend <code>ExecuteAndRun</code> not <code>Suite</code>, such
as <code>BeforeAndAfter</code>. This makes such traits stackable behaviors that can be mixed into a <code>Suite</code> while not
being a <code>Suite</code> themselves.</li>
<li>Removed <code>testWithInformer</code> and <code>ignoreWithInformer</code> methods from <code>FunSuite</code>, because they were
simply too ugly to live. Unfortunately these were not deprecated, so if you used them you'll need to already make an adjustment to upgrade
to 0.9.4. What replaced them is an imperative approach, which while more error prone will work fine unless abused, and makes
for much nicer client code. There's a new method named <code>info</code> in <code>FunSuite</code>, which returns an <code>Informer</code>.
So where before you said:

<pre class="indent">
testWithInformer("test name") {
  info => {
    info("send info to the reporter")
  }
}
</pre>

Now you'll just say:

<pre class="indent">
test("test name") {
  info("send info to the reporter")
}
</pre>

During suite execution, the <code>info</code> method returns an <code>Informer</code> that immediately forwards information passed to its <code>apply</code>
methods to the reporter. During construction of the object, the <code>info</code> method returns an <code>Informer</code> that saves the information
passed to its <code>apply</code> methods for later sending to the reporter when the suite is executed. At any other time, the <code>info</code>
method will return an <code>Informer</code> that throws an exception.
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in 0.9.3</h2>

<ul>
<li>Moved <code>FunSuite</code> from the <code>org.scalatest.fun</code> to <code>org.scalatest</code> package.</li>
<li>Dropped <code>FunSuite1</code> through <code>FunSuite9</code>, which were also in the <code>org.scalatest.fun</code> package, because the surface area
they added to the API didn't seem worth the small savings in code size over creating "with" methods with meaningful
names and explicitly calling them.</li>
<li>Added an <code>ImpSuite</code>, which can be mixed into another suite to gain methods that will run before and after each suite and test.</li>
<li>Updated the portions of Scaladoc comments for <code>Suite</code> and <code>FunSuite</code> that discuss mutable fixtures. Dropped
the suggestion to override <code>runTest</code>, which still works but is verbose, and instead recommended defining and explicitly calling "create" methods or
"with" methods from tests that need the mutable fixtures, or mixing in <code>ImpSuite</code> and using <code>beforeEach</code>, <code>afterEach</code>, etc.</li>
<li>Added an <code>Informer</code> trait, which provides a simpler way to send information to the <code>infoProvided</code>
method of a <code>Reporter</code>.</li>
<li>Changed <code>Suite</code> such that instead of being able to define test methods that take a <code>Reporter</code>, you can define
test methods that take an <code>Informer</code>. Replaced the section of scaladoc for <code>Suite</code> that used to explain how to 
use a passed-in <code>Reporter</code> to now show how to use an <code>Informer</code>.</li>
<li>Changed <code>FunSuite</code> such that instead of being able to register tests whose function values take a <code>Reporter</code>, you can register
tests whose function values take an <code>Informer</code>. Changed the names of the registration methods from <code>test/ignoreWithReporter</code> to
<code>test/ignoreWithInformer</code>. Replaced the section of scaladoc for <code>FunSuite</code> that used to explain how to 
use a <code>Reporter</code> passed in to a test function to now show how to use an <code>Informer</code>.</li>
<li>Moved <code>org.scalatest.scalacheck.CheckSuite</code> to <code>org.scalatest.prop.Checkers</code>, and renamed its <code>checkProperty</code>
methods to plain old <code>check</code>.</li>
<li>Added <code>PropSuite</code>, a subtrait of <code>FunSuite</code>, which offers methods that register tests composed of a single property check.</li>
<li>Improved the messages generated by the <code>assert(... === ...)</code> and <code>expect(...){...}</code> methods. Strings are now reported surrounded
by double quotes, with ends truncated where matching if very long, and with square brackets surrounding the portions that differ. Characters are reported
surrounded by single quotes, integer and floating point numbers as is, and any other object's <code>toString</code> result surrounded by angle brackets.</li>
<li>Removed dollar signs and non-essential text from suite and test names in reports when running from the interpreter.</li>
<li>Improved the look of the output generated by the build-in reporters that print to the standard out, error, or to files.</li>
<li>Added a section to <code>Suite</code>'s scaladoc that describes using external assertions, such as JUnit's assertions, Hamcrest
matchers, or specs matchers, in ScalaTest tests.</li>
<li>Improved the failure message when a ScalaCheck property check fails.</li>
<li>Renamed user-defined properties to "goodies," because the term "properties" was overloaded to mean both key-value pairs that can be passed to suites
and ScalaCheck-like properties. "Goodies" is not a very obvious name, so suggestions for improvement are welcome.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in 0.9.2</h2>

<ul>
<li>Moved <code>Runner</code> from <code>org.scalatest</code> to <code>org.scalatest.tools</code> package.</li>
<li>Added JUnit integration classes in package <code>org.scalatest.junit</code>.</li>
<li>Added TestNG integration classes in package <code>org.scalatest.testng</code>.</li>
<li>Added ScalaCheck integration classes in package <code>org.scalatest.scalacheck</code>.</li>
<li>Added <code>FunSuite</code> family of traits in package <code>org.scalatest.fun</code>.</li>
<li>Added an Ant task.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes in 0.9.1</h2>

<ul>
<li>Changed <code>testGroups</code> method name to <code>groups</code>.</li>
<li>Changed operand names of <code>===</code>, from <code>expected === actual</code> to <code>left === right</code>.</li>
<li>Changed message generated from <code>2 === 1</code>, from <code>"Expected 1, but got 2"</code> to <code>"2 did not equal 1"</code>.</li>
<li>Changed <code>expect</code> method name to <code>intercept</code>.</li>
<li>Dropped <code>expectNPE</code> and <code>expectIAE</code> methods.</li>
<li>Added a different <code>expect</code> method, which takes an expected and actual value. <code>expect(1) {2}</code> would generate
the error message <code>"Expected 1, but got 2</code>.</li>
<li>Made versions of <code>expect</code> and <code>intercept</code> that take a <code>message</code>.</li>
<li>Implemented a <code>Suite</code> discovery mechanism in <code>Runner</code>, accessed via <code>-m</code> or <code>-w</code>
command-line arguments.</li>
<li>Dropped <code>!==</code> method from the great <code>Equalizer</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known issues</h2>

<ol>
<li>Reloading classes from JAR files between runs in the GUI doesn't work, because URLClassLoader uses a JAR cache. For now, you'll have to restart the app to pick
up new classes in JAR files. But a better alternative is to simply point ScalaTest to the build directory containing .class files produced by the Scala and
Java compiler. URLClassLoader will not cache these files, so changes to them will be picked up each time you press the Run or Rerun buttons.</li>
</ol>
