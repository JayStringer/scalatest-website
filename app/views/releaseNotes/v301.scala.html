        <h1>ScalaTest/Scalactic 3.0.1 Release Notes</h1>

        <p>
            ScalaTest/Scalactic 3.0.1 includes the enhancements and bug fixes listed below. No source code using
            ScalaTest/ScalaUtils 3.0 or higher should break, but from any version other than other 3.0.x releases (with which this release is binary
            compatible), you will likely need to do a clean build to upgrade.
        </p>
