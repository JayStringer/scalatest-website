<h1>ScalaTest/Scalactic 3.0.0-M15 Release Notes</h1>

<p>
<strong><em>Note: Eventually this will be the home for the 3.0.0 final release notes. These release notes are written
from the perspective of the final release, but with 3.0.0 replaced with 3.0.0-M15, the current milestone version.</em></strong>
</p>

<p>
ScalaTest 3.0.0-M15 is a major upgrade to ScalaTest and Scalactic, the culmination of over a year of effort. Although it
includes many enhancements, we kept a close eye on compatibility with existing ScalaTest/Scalactic 2.x code.
We also tried hard to preserve what people liked about both ScalaTest and Scalactic: that it is simple, the code is clean
and clear, it's fully documented, and because of very thorough testing, it &ldquo;just works.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>

<h2>Highlights</h2>

<p>
The most significant enhancement to ScalaTest and Scalactic in the 3.0.0-M15 release is that they now fully support Scala.js.
The advent of Scala.js represented a major, completely unforeseen change in requirements for ScalaTest.
As a result, Scala.js support required a
rather large number of changes to the ScalaTest's eight-year old codebase. Fortunately, the changes
were almost entirely internal to ScalaTest, so no existing ScalaTest user code (i.e., for Scala on the
JVM) should break because of the addition of Scala.js support.
</p>

<p>
Scalactic 3.0.0-M15 does include one change that could in theory break 2.2.x user code, but we expect
the numbers of users and amount of code affected to be quite small in practice. ScalaTest 3.0.0-M15, on the other hand should include
<em>no breaking changes</em> to existing 2.2.x code so long as all deprecation warnings have been cleared prior to
upgrading. For most users, upgrading to ScalaTest
and/or Scalactic 3.0.0-M15 should require only a clean build with the new version.
ScalaTest 3.0.0-M15 does include several deprecation expirations, the removal of features 
that were deprecated at the time of the 2.0.0 release, October 2013. For more detail, see the
<a href="#potentialBreakages">potential breakages</a> and the <a href="#expiredDeprecations">expired deprecations</a> sections below.
</p>

<p>
The SuperSafe compiler plugin has also been enhanced with some new features that give compiler errors for Scalactic's <code>===</code>
operator and ScalaTest's <code>equal</code>, <code>be</code>, and <code>contain</code> matchers. These features are enabled
by default in SuperSafe's Community Edition (i.e., they don't require a SuperSafe license key to be installed), so all you
need to do is add the plugin to your project. For more details, see the <a href="#supersafeEnhancements">SuperSafe enhancements</a> below.
</p>

<p>
Here's a list of the main enhancements in Scalactic 3.0.0-M15:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Added support for Scala.js.</li>
<li>Added <code>org.scalactic.exceptions.NullArgumentException</code>, and changed all places in ScalaTest
and Scalactic that threw <code>NullPointerException</code> in earlier releases to throw <code>NullArgumentException</code>.
Although throwing <code>NullPointerException</code> is the tradition in Java APIs, Scala.js does not support a
<code>NullPointerException</code>. To make the behavior
consistent on both the JVM and Scala.js, the change to throwing <code>NullArgumentException</code> was made throughout 
the ScalaTest and Scalactic, including the <code>requireNonNull</code> method of trait <code>Requirements</code>.</li>
<li>Positive numeric types, such as <code>PosInt</code>, <code>PosZInt</code>, <code>PosFloat</code>, <em>etc.</em>, have been
added in package <code>org.scalactic.anyvals</code> along with <code>CompileTimeAssertions</code>, which you can help you
create your own restricted value <code>AnyVal</code> types.</li>
<li>Renamed <code>Constraint</code> to <code>CanEqual</code> and made a deprecated type alias for any user code currently
referring to <code>Constraint</code>.</li>
<!--<li>Added a concise type lambda syntax to <code>Or</code>'s companion object. <code>Or.G[Int]#B</code> means an <code>Or</code>
with a "good" type, <code>G</code>, of <code>Int</code> and the "bad" type, <code>B</code>, unspecified. <code>Or.B[ErrorMessage]#G</code> means an <code>Or</code>
with a "bad" type, <code>B</code>, of <code>ErrorMessage</code> and the "good" type, <code>G</code>, unspecified.</li>-->
<li>Made <code>Chain</code> an <code>AnyVal</code> that wraps <code>List</code> instead of an <code>AnyRef</code>.
Dropped its inheritance relationship with <code>PartialFunction</code>.</li>
<li>Dropped unused type param in <code>Good</code> and <code>Bad</code>, specifying <code>Nothing</code> for that now missing type parameter
when extending <code>Or</code>. This is a breaking change, but one which we don't expect will affect much client code in practice.</li>
<li>Added a <code>validating</code> method to <code>TrySugar</code>, and added <code>FutureSugar</code> also with a <code>validating</code>
method. Also added <code>ValidationFailedException</code> to support these <code>validating</code> methods as well.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here's a list of the main enhancements in ScalaTest 3.0.0-M15:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Added support for Scala.js.</li>
<li>Defined <code>org.scalatest.Assertion</code> as a type alias for the singleton type, <a href="@{milestoneScaladoc}/index.html#org.scalatest.Succeeded$"><code>org.scalatest.Succeeded.type</code></a>.</li>
<li>Changed the result type of assertions and matcher expressions from <code>Unit</code> to <code>Assertion</code>.</li>
<li>Changed the result type of <code>org.scalatest</code> styles from <code>Unit</code> to <code>Any</code> so that users who
compile with <code>-Ywarn-value-discard</code> will not get warnings for tests that end in an assertion or matcher expression,
which no longer has a <code>Unit</code> result type.</li>
<li>Added "async" testing styles--<a href="@{milestoneScaladoc}/index.html#org.scalatest.AsyncFunSuite"><code>AsyncFunSuite</code></a>,
<a href="@{milestoneScaladoc}/index.html#org.scalatest.AsyncFunSpec"><code>AsyncFunSpec</code></a>,
<a href="@{milestoneScaladoc}/index.html#org.scalatest.AsyncFlatSpec"><code>AsyncFlatSpec</code></a>,
<a href="@{milestoneScaladoc}/index.html#org.scalatest.AsyncFreeSpec"><code>AsyncFreeSpec</code></a>,
<a href="@{milestoneScaladoc}/index.html#org.scalatest.AsyncWordSpec"><code>AsyncWordspec</code></a>, and
<a href="@{milestoneScaladoc}/index.html#org.scalatest.AsyncFeatureSpec"><code>AsyncFeatureSpec</code></a>--in which
the result type of tests is <code>Future[Assertion]</code>.
</li>
<li>Deprecated <a href="@{milestoneScaladoc}/#org.scalatest.prop.Configuration$PropertyCheckConfig"><code>PropertyCheckConfig</code></a> in
favor of <a href="@{milestoneScaladoc}/#org.scalatest.prop.Configuration$PropertyCheckConfiguration"><code>PropertyCheckConfiguration</code></a> in 
object <code>org.scalatest.prop.Configuration</code>. The new class uses <code>org.scalactic.anyvals</code> and instead of an absolute
<code>maxDiscarded</code> value, calculates that value by multiplying a <code>maxDiscardFactor</code> by the <code>minSuccessful</code> value.
</li>
<li>Added overloaded <code>exists</code> and <code>forEvery</code> methods to <code>TableDrivenPropertyChecks</code>. <code>exists</code> succeeds if at
least one row of the table satisfies the assertion block. <code>forEvery</code> requires that all rows of the table satisfy the assertion
block, like <code>forAll</code>, but reports information about all rows that fail the assertion block (where <code>forAll</code>
just reports the first row that fails and short circuits).</li>
<li>Enhanced ScalaTest matchers with <code>oneElementOf</code>, <code>noElementsOf</code>, <code>atLeastOneElementOf</code>, <code>atMostOneElementOf</code>, <code>allElementsOf</code>, <code>inOrderElementsOf</code> syntax, all of which must follow <code>contain</code>.</li>
<li>Modified ScalaTest's <code>BeforeAndAfterEach</code> and <code>BeforeAndAfter</code> so that it will interact properly and
consistently when mixed in either before and after <code>OneInstancePerTest</code>.<!--scaladoc this behavior--></li>
<li>Did a bit of modularization. scalatest.jar, scalatest-all.jar, scalactic.jar</li>
</ul>

<h2>Potential breakages</h2>

<p>
Although we have worked hard to ensure the vast majority of ScalaTest 2.2.x code to compile under 3.0.0-M15, ScalaTest 3.0.0-M15 does include a small
number of changes that can break existing code. To see the list, and learn
how to migrate your code if affected, see the <a href="/user_guide/migrating_to_20">migration guide</a>.
</p>

<a name="newDeprecations"></a>
<h2>New deprecations</h2>

<p>
Deprecated the parameterless <code>execute</code> method on <code>Suite</code>. Please use the empty parens version instead: <code>execute()</code>.
</p>

<p>Deprecated <code>ConversionCheckedTripleEquals</code>, because code that is using it can still compile but mean something quite different
if it is removed. Most people who used <code>ConversionCheckedTripleEquals</code> did so to allow numeric comparisons such as
<code>1 === 1L</code> to compile, while still getting a type error for comarisons like <code>"one" === 1</code>.
If that was your driving use case, we recommend you use the community (free) features of the Artima SuperSafe compiler plugin to
get the type checking you desire with plain old <code>org.scalactic.TripleEquals</code>. If you were using <code>ConversionCheckedTripleEquals</code>
more generally, to compare two of your own types for equality that have an implicit conversion between them, we recommend you use
a type annotation on the "from" type. For example, if you have an implicit conversion from <code>Foo</code> to </code>Bar</code>, and you had
the following comparison enabled by <code>ConversionCheckedTripleEquals</code> (where <code>foo</code> is type <code>Foo</code>
and <code>bar</code> is type <code>Bar</code>):
</p>

<pre>
import ConversionCheckedTripleEquals._
assert(foo === bar)
</pre>

<p>
Instead use a type annotation on <code>foo</code> so that the compiler will convert it to <code>Bar</code>, like this:
</p>

<pre>
import TripleEquals._
assert((foo: Bar) === bar)
</pre>

<ul>
<li>Deprecated the <code>withGood</code> method in <code>org.scalactic.Accumulation</code> that takes one <code>Or</code>
and one transformation function. Please call <code>map</code> on the <code>Or</code>
and pass in the same function instead.</li>
<li>Deprecated the <code>asOr</code> method on <code>Or</code>, because its main use case is now obsolete, since
Good(value).orBad[Type] and Good[Type].orBad(value) now return Or. You can simply remove <code>asOr</code> invocation from
such expressions, or if used elsewhere, replace it with a widening type annotation, such as: <code>(hasTypeGood: Int Or ErrorMessage)</code>.
</li>
<li>Deprecated <code>org.scalactic.Constraint</code>. Please change any occurences to its new name, <code>CanEqual</code>. (<code>Constraint</code>
should appear explicitly in user code only very rarely if at all, as normally it will be used only implicitly.)</li>
<li>
Added an already deprecated implicit conversion because the inheritance relationship between <code>Filter</code> and <code>Function2[Set[String], Map[String, Set[String]], List[(String, Boolean)]]</code> was removed. Most likely this implicit conversion will not be needed by any user code, but if you see the deprecation warning, please change the use to the apply method that takes a suiteId instead, the one with this signature: <code>def apply(testNames: Set[String], testTags: Map[String, Set[String]], suiteId: String): List[(String, Boolean)]</code>.
</li>
<li>
Deprecated the old way of doing <code>org.scalatest.prop.Configuration</code> in favor of the new way.
</li>
<li>
See if we should remove Rerunner.
</li>
<li>Did I deprecate toOr on Or?</li>
<li>
Also we changed the defaults of the scalacheck config.
</li>
<li>Deprecated in Accumulation the withGood method that takes one param, because that's the same as map</li>

</ul>

<code>org.scalatest.matchers</code>, in favor of <a href="@latestScaladoc/#org.scalatest.Matchers"><code>Matchers</code></a>,
and <a href="@latestScaladoc/#org.scalatest.MustMatchers"><code>MustMatchers</code></a>,
which resides in package <code>org.scalatest</code>.
</li>
<li>
Removed the <code>beforeAll</code> and <code>afterAll</code> methods of trait
<a href="@latestScaladoc/#org.scalatest.BeforeAndAfterAll"><code>BeforeAndAfterAll</code></a> that take a config map (deprecated in ScalaTest 2.0)

<code>Given</code>/<code>When</code>/<code>Then</code>/<code>And</code>, because <code>then</code> was deprecated as an identifier in Scala 2.10.
</li>
<li>Removed the two original <code>apply</code> methods on <a href="@latestScaladoc/#org.scalatest.Filter"><code>Filter</code></a> (deprecated in ScalaTest 2.0), in favor of
two new ones added in ScalaTest 2.0 that take an additional <code>suiteId</code> parameter.</li>

in favor of trait <a href="@latestScaladoc/#org.scalatest.SuiteMixin"><code>SuiteMixin</code></a>, which since 2.0 has served as the base class
for stackable traits that can be mixed into <code>Suite</code>.</li>
<li>
Removed the original <code>apply</code> method on <a href="@latestScaladoc/#org.scalatest.Distributor"><code>Distributor</code></a> (deprecated in ScalaTest 2.0) in favor of the <code>apply</code> method added in 2.0 that takes a <a href="@latestScaladoc/#org.scalatest.Args"><code>Args</code></a>.
</li>
