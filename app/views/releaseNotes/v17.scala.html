<h1>ScalaTest Release Notes</h1>

<h2>Changes in 1.7.2 (for Scala 2.9.0+ and Scala 2.8.1+)</h2>

<p>
ScalaTest 1.7.2 is identical to 1.7.1 except for two changes: the argument "sequential" is ignored to facilitate Play 2.0 integration and
a bug in the ScalaTest Framework has been fixed. The bug that was fixed was that when running with sbt, ScalaTest would keep a thread going
after the tests were completed. This thread is now not created in the first place.
</p>

<h2>Changes in 1.7.1 (for Scala 2.9.0+ and Scala 2.8.1+)</h2>

<p>
ScalaTest 1.7.1 is identical to 1.7 except for one change: the Guice dependency in the pom.xml file has been made optional. This minor
pom file error in 1.7 unfortunately caused a much more serious deployment problem: the wrong jar files were deployed to scala-tools.org (mirrored
on Maven Central) under artifact IDs
scalatest_2.8.2, scalatest_2.9.0-1, and scalatest_2.9.1. The jar files for 1.7.RC2 were incorrectly deployed instead. We redeployed
correct 1.7 jar files over the top as soon as we discovered the problem, but because the incorrect jars escaped and were in the repository for a while
we released 1.7.1 one day later so people can be sure they are getting good jar files from the Maven repositories.
</p>

<p>
To see the changes in 1.7.1 from the previous releases (1.6.1 and 1.5.1), therefore, look at the <a href="#release17">release notes for 1.7</a>.

<h2>Changes in 1.7 (for Scala 2.9.0+ and Scala 2.8.1+)</h2>

<p>
ScalaTest 1.7 is source (but not necessarily binary) compatible with previous releases. To upgrade from 1.5.1 or 1.6.1, you should only
need to do a clean build.
</p>

<p>
This release includes the following enhancements, bug fixes, dependency changes, and deprecations: 
</p>

<p>
<em>Enhancements:</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Added trait <code>Inside</code>, which lets you make assertions about values 
extracted from an object via a pattern match</li>
<li>Added traits <code>OptionValues</code>, <code>EitherValues</code>, and <code>PartialFunctionValues</code>, 
which allow you to make one-liner assertions about values that 
<em>should</em> exist in <code>Option</code>s, <code>Either</code>s, and <code>PartialFunction</code>s</li>
<li>Added extra methods on <code>MockitoSugar</code> for new mock methods added to <code>Mockito</code></li>
<li>Added <code>WrapWith</code> annotation to enable ScalaTest to run non-<code>Suite</code>s, 
similar to JUnit's <code>RunWith</code> annotation</li>
<li>Added trait <code>NonImplicitAssertions</code>, which turns off the lone implicit 
conversion you get by default in a ScalaTest suite</li>
<li>Made <code>Event</code> and <code>Ordinal</code> serializable, as well as internal 
implementations of <code>Rerunner</code>, to make it easier to run tests in a 
different VM across a network</li>
<li>OSGI-enabled ScalaTest's jar file</li>
<li>Added companion objects for <code>EasyMockSugar</code> and <code>MockitoSugar</code>, selfless traits</li>
<li>Improved Scaladoc examples for shared tests, removing dependency on 
test order in the <code>SharedBehaviors</code> traits</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Bug fixes</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Made <code>OneInstancePerTest</code> report tests tagged as ignored as Ignored 
rather than running them. To fix this, had to change the semantics of 
run slightly, but in a way that is unlikely to break any user code. 
Now if you pass the name of a test marked as ignored to <code>Suite.run</code>, the 
test will be reported as ignored. Previously it would be run even 
though it was marked as ignored. So now ignore always means ignore 
(and that is arguably an improvement because it is more consistent). 
The upshot is that if you want to run a test marked as ignored, you 
need to take the ignore annotation off, then run it.</li>
<li>Added a hack to fire a test failed event for a test named <code>"!!! Suite 
Aborted !!!"</code> in the case of a <code>SuiteAborted</code> event when running with 
sbt. Will eventually help enhance sbt's <code>Framework</code> to do this the right 
way, but for now, at least sbt won't think that nothing went wrong.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in <code>GeneratorDrivenPropertyChecks</code>. Previously if you 
supplied generator, name string tuples to <code>forAll</code>, and the property 
check failed, the names you supplied wouldn't show up in the error 
message. Instead the error message would just show generic names 
<code>arg0</code>, <code>arg1,</code> <em>etc.</em> Now it shows the supplied names.</li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Dependency Changes</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Upgraded EasyMock from 3.0 to 3.1</li>
<li>Upgraded Added a dependency that TestNG needed on Guice 3.0</li>
<li>Upgraded JUnit from 4.4 to 4.10</li>
<li>Upgraded TestNG from 5.7 to 6.3.1. This was the tricky one, because 
some binary incompatible things happened in TestNG between 5.7 and 
6.3.1. We used reflection internally to deal with it dynamically, so 
you should be able to still use older versions of TestNG without 
getting <code>ClassNotFoundErrors</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
<em>Deprecations</em>
</p>

<ul>
<li>Deprecated -t in favor of -b in <code>Runner</code>, for running TestNG test 
suites (-t will still work during deprecation cycle, but you'll get a 
deprecation warning.) 
<li>Deprecated <code>Rerunner</code> with a note asking if anyone is using it. If we 
don't hear back that anyone is using it, there's a good chance we'll 
remove it in 2.0  (<code>Rerunner</code> will still work during deprecation cycle, 
but you'll get a deprecation warning.) 
<li>Deprecated <code>org.scalatest.fixture.FixtureX</code> in favor of 
<code>org.scalatest.fixture.X</code>. So <code>fixture.FixtureWordSpec</code> became 
<code>fixture.WordSpec</code>, <code>fixture.FixtureFunSuite</code> became <code>fixture.FunSuite</code>, 
<em>etc.</em> (The old names will still work during deprecation cycle, but 
you'll get a deprecation warning until you change the names.) 
<li>Deprecated <code>that</code> in favor of <code>which</code> in <code>WordSpec</code> and 
<code>fixture.WordSpec</code> (<code>that</code> will still work during the deprecation cycle, 
but you'll get a deprecation warning until you change uses to <code>which</code>. 
We plan to reuse <code>that</code> for a different purpose in the future.) 
<li>Deprecated <code>org.scalatest.Spec</code> in favor of <code>org.scalatest.FunSpec</code>, and 
<code>org.scalatest.fixture.FixtureSpec</code> in favor of 
<code>org.scalatest.fixture.FunSpec</code>. (The old names will still work during 
the deprecation cycle, but you'll get a deprecation warning. We plan 
to reuse <code>Spec</code> for a different purpose in the future.) 
</ul>
