<h1>ScalaTest/Scalactic 2.2.0-M1 Release Notes</h1>

<p>
ScalaTest/Scalactic 2.2.0-M1 includes the enhancements and deprecations listed below. No source code using
ScalaTest/ScalaUtils 2.1.x should break, but you will likely need to do a clean build to upgrade.
</p>

<p>
For information on how to include ScalaTest in your project, see the <a href="/download">download page</a>.
</p>

<h2><code>org.scalautils</code> => <code>org.scalactic</code></h2>

<p>In 2.2.0, <code>org.scalautils</code> has been renamed to <code>org.scalactic</code> (rhymes with "galactic"). All existing code using <code>org.scalautils</code> directly will continue to work, but will receive a deprecation warning. Please change <code>scalautils</code> to <code>scalactic</code> when convenient, because after a lengthy deprecation period, <code>org.scalautils</code> will be removed.</p>

<p>
ScalaUtils started out as a small library carved out of ScalaTest that made sense for production code as well as tests. It has since been growing into its own, and 
deserved a more distinctive name. The name "scalactic" comes from this <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/3087.html">2009 scala-internals discussion</a>.
I proposed it as a word to mean Scala-like, like "Pythonic" for Python. It never caught on for that, so instead I thought it might work well as the new name for ScalaUtils.
Also, because Scalactic precedes ScalaTest alphabetically, its documentation shows up at the top of the combined Scaladoc instead of the bottom, where ScalaUtils has
less prominently appeared since 2.0.
</p>

<h2>Enhanced <code>Assertions</code> error messages</h2>

<p>Enhanced the macro that produces error messages from the <a href="@{latestScaladoc}/index.html#org.scalatest.Assertions"><code>Assertions</code></a> trait.
Here are some examples:</p>

<pre>
scala&gt; import org.scalatest._
import org.scalatest._

scala&gt; import Assertions._
import Assertions._

scala&gt; val a = 1
a: Int = 1

scala&gt; val b = 2
b: Int = 2

scala&gt; val c = 3
c: Int = 3

scala&gt; val d = 4
d: Int = 4

scala&gt; assert(a == b || c &gt;= d) 
org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: 1 did not equal 2, and 3 was not greater than or equal to 4
	at org.scalatest.Assertions$class.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:422)
	...

scala&gt; val xs = List(1, 2, 3)
xs: List[Int] = List(1, 2, 3)

scala&gt; assert(xs.exists(_ == 4))
org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: List(1, 2, 3) did not contain 4
	at org.scalatest.Assertions$class.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:422)
	...

scala&gt; assert("hello".startsWith("h") &amp;&amp; "goodbye".endsWith("y"))
org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: "hello" started with "h", but "goodbye" did not end with "y"
	at org.scalatest.Assertions$class.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:422)
	...

scala&gt; assert(num.isInstanceOf[Int])
org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: 1.0 was not instance of scala.Int
	at org.scalatest.Assertions$class.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:422)
	...

scala&gt; assert(Some(2).isEmpty)
org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: Some(2) was not empty
	at org.scalatest.Assertions$class.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:422)
	...
</pre>

<p>
The macro works by recognizing patterns in the AST of the expression passed to <code>assert</code> and,
for a finite set of common expressions, giving an error message that an equivalent ScalaTest matcher
expression would give. For expressions that are not recognized, the macro prints out a string
representation of the (desugared) AST and adds <code>"was false"</code>. Here are some examples of
error messages for unrecognized expressions:
</p>

<pre>
scala&gt; assert(None.isDefined)
org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: scala.None.isDefined was false
	at org.scalatest.Assertions$class.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:422)
	...

scala&gt; assert(xs.exists(i =&gt; i &gt; 10))
org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: xs.exists(((i: Int) => i.>(10))) was false
	at org.scalatest.Assertions$class.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:422)
        ...
</pre>

<h2>Added <code>DiagrammedAssertions</code></h2>

<p>Building on work that Peter Niederwieser has done in <a href="http://code.google.com/p/spock/">Spock</a> and <a href="https://github.com/pniederw/expecty">Expecty</a>, 2.2.0 introduces trait <a href="@{latestScaladoc}/index.html#org.scalatest.DiagrammedAssertions"><code>DiagrammedAssertions</code></a>. This trait extends <code>Assertions</code> and overrides its <code>assert</code> methods, modifying the default macro to give error messages that show the original line of code and the value of each part of the expression. Here are some examples:</p>

<pre>
scala&gt; import DiagrammedAssertions._
import DiagrammedAssertions._

scala&gt; assert(a == b || c &gt;= d) 
org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: 

assert(a == b || c &gt;= d)
       | |  | |  | |  |
       1 |  2 |  3 |  4
         |    |    false
         |    false
         false

	at org.scalatest.Assertions$class.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:422)
	...

scala&gt; assert(xs.exists(_ == 4))
org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: 

assert(xs.exists(_ == 4))
       |  |
       |  false
       List(1, 2, 3)

	at org.scalatest.Assertions$class.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:422)
	...

scala&gt; assert("hello".startsWith("h") &amp;&amp; "goodbye".endsWith("y"))
org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: 

assert("hello".startsWith("h") &amp;&amp; "goodbye".endsWith("y"))
       |       |          |    |  |         |        |
       "hello" true       "h"  |  "goodbye" false    "y"
                               false

	at org.scalatest.Assertions$class.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:422)
	...

scala&gt; assert(num.isInstanceOf[Int])
org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: 

assert(num.isInstanceOf[Int])
       |   |
       1.0 false

	at org.scalatest.Assertions$class.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:422)
	...

scala&gt; assert(Some(2).isEmpty)
org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: 

assert(Some(2).isEmpty)
       |    |  |
       |    2  false
       Some(2)

	at org.scalatest.Assertions$class.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:422)
	...

scala&gt; assert(None.isDefined)
org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: 

assert(None.isDefined)
       |    |
       None false

	at org.scalatest.Assertions$class.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:422)
	...

scala&gt; assert(xs.exists(i =&gt; i &gt; 10))
org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: 

assert(xs.exists(i =&gt; i &gt; 10))
       |  |
       |  false
       List(1, 2, 3)

	at org.scalatest.Assertions$class.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:422)
	...
</pre>

<p>
If the expression passed to <code>assert</code> spans more than one line, <code>DiagrammedAssertions</code> falls
back to the default style of error message, since drawing a diagram would be difficult. Here's an example:
</p>

<pre>
scala&gt; assert("hello".startsWith("h") &amp;&amp;
     |   "goodbye".endsWith("y"))
org.scalatest.exceptions.TestFailedException: "hello" started with "h", but "goodbye" did not end with "y"
	at org.scalatest.Assertions$class.newAssertionFailedException(Assertions.scala:422)
	...
</pre>

<h2>Scalactic <code>Requirements</code></h2>

<p>Scalactic includes a new trait that was not in ScalaUtils called <a href="@{latestScaladoc}/index.html#org.scalactic.Requirements"><code>Requirements</code></a>. This trait applies macros to the task of pre-condition checking through methods named <code>require</code>, <code>requireState</code>, and <code>requireNonNull</code>. The <code>require</code> methods throw <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>, like the <code>require</code> methods of <code>Predef</code>, but give an error message extracted from the AST.</p>

<p>
The error messages produced by <code>require</code> are the same as those of the <code>assert</code> methods of ScalaTest's <code>Assertions</code> trait. Here's an example:
</p>

<pre>
scala&gt; import org.scalactic._
import org.scalactic._

scala&gt; import Requirements._
import Requirements._

scala&gt; val a = 1
a: Int = 1

scala&gt; val b = 2
b: Int = 2

scala&gt; val c = 3
c: Int = 3

scala&gt; val d = 4
d: Int = 4

scala&gt; require(a == b || c &gt;= d) 
java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: 1 did not equal 2, and 3 was not greater than or equal to 4
	at org.scalactic.Requirements$RequirementsHelper.macroRequire(Requirements.scala:56)
	...
</pre>

<p>
The <code>requireState</code> method provides identical error messages to <code>require</code>, but throw <code>IllegalStateException</code> instead of <code>IllegalArgumentException</code>:
</p>

<pre>
scala&gt; requireState(a == b || c &gt;= d) 
java.lang.IllegalStateException: 1 did not equal 2, and 3 was not greater than or equal to 4
	at org.scalactic.Requirements$RequirementsHelper.macroRequireState(Requirements.scala:71)
	...
</pre>

<p>
The <code>requireNonNull</code> method takes one or more variables as arguments and throws <code>NullPointerException</code> with an error messages that includes the variable names if any are <code>null</code>. Here's an example:
</p>

<pre>
scala&gt; val e: String = null
e: String = null

scala&gt; val f: java.util.Date = null
f: java.util.Date = null

scala&gt; requireNonNull(a, b, c, d, e, f)
java.lang.NullPointerException: e and f were null
	at org.scalactic.Requirements$RequirementsHelper.macroRequireNonNull(Requirements.scala:101)
	...
</pre>

<h2>Scalactic <code>Snapshots</code></h2>

<p>Scalactic also includes a new trait named <a href="@{latestScaladoc}/index.html#org.scalatest.Snapshots"><code>Snapshots</code></a> that was not part of ScalaUtils. <code>Snapshots</code> provides a <code>snap</code> method that takes one or more arguments and results in a <code>SnapshotSeq</code>, whose <code>toString</code> lists the names and values of each argument:</p>

<pre>
scala&gt; import Snapshots._
import Snapshots._

scala&gt; snap(a, b, c, d, e, f)
res3: org.scalactic.SnapshotSeq = a was 1, b was 2, c was 3, d was 4, e was null, f was null
</pre>

<p><code>SnapshotSeq</code> offers a <code>lines</code> method that places each variable name/value pair on its own line:<p>

<pre>
scala&gt; snap(a, b, c, d, e, f).lines
res4: String = 
a was 1
b was 2
c was 3
d was 4
e was null
f was null
</pre>

<p>
Or, because a <code>SnapshotSeq</code> is a <code>IndexedSeq[Snapshot]</code>, you can process it just like any other <code>Seq</code>, for example:
</p>

<pre>
scala&gt; snap(a, b, c, d, e, f).mkString("Wow! ", ", and ", ". That's so awesome!")
res6: String = Wow! a was 1, and b was 2, and c was 3, and d was 4, and e was null, and f was null. That's so awesome!
</pre>

<h2><code>Assertions</code> and <code>Matchers</code> enhancements</h2>

<p>Added <code>matchPattern</code>.</p>

<p>Added <code>should</code> <code>compile</code> syntax.</p>

<p>Deprecated <code>assertTypeError</code> in favor of <code>assertDoesNotCompile</code>. Added <code>assertCompiles</code> syntax.</p>

<li>Added <code>recover</code> and <code>recoverWith</code> methods to <code>Or</code>.</li>

<li>Loosened type restrictions on HTML 5 input elements in the <a href="@{latestScaladoc}/index.html#org.scalatest.selenium.WebBrowser"><code>WebBrowser</code></a> trait's Selenium DSL to better support browsers that do not fully support the new elements. (Contributed by Matt Hughes.)</li>
</ul>

<!--
