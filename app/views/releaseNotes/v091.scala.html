<h1>ScalaTest 0.9.1 Release Notes</h1>

<h2>Changes in 0.9.1</h2>

<ul>
<li>Changed <code>testGroups</code> method name to <code>groups</code>.</li>
<li>Changed operand names of <code>===</code>, from <code>expected === actual</code> to <code>left === right</code>.</li>
<li>Changed message generated from <code>2 === 1</code>, from <code>"Expected 1, but got 2"</code> to <code>"2 did not equal 1"</code>.</li>
<li>Changed <code>expect</code> method name to <code>intercept</code>.</li>
<li>Dropped <code>expectNPE</code> and <code>expectIAE</code> methods.</li>
<li>Added a different <code>expect</code> method, which takes an expected and actual value. <code>expect(1) {2}</code> would generate
the error message <code>"Expected 1, but got 2</code>.</li>
<li>Made versions of <code>expect</code> and <code>intercept</code> that take a <code>message</code>.</li>
<li>Implemented a <code>Suite</code> discovery mechanism in <code>Runner</code>, accessed via <code>-m</code> or <code>-w</code>
command-line arguments.</li>
<li>Dropped <code>!==</code> method from the great <code>Equalizer</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Known issues</h2>

<ol>
<li>Reloading classes from JAR files between runs in the GUI doesn't work, because URLClassLoader uses a JAR cache. For now, you'll have to restart the app to pick
up new classes in JAR files. But a better alternative is to simply point ScalaTest to the build directory containing .class files produced by the Scala and
Java compiler. URLClassLoader will not cache these files, so changes to them will be picked up each time you press the Run or Rerun buttons.</li>
</ol>
