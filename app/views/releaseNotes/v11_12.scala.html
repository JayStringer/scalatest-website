<h1>ScalaTest Release Notes</h1>

<a name="release11and12"></a>
<h2>Changes in 1.1 (for Scala 2.7.x) and 1.2 (for Scala 2.8.x)</h2>

<p>
Note: ScalaTest 1.1 and 1.2 basically have identical feature sets. The only difference is the Scala version they support. ScalaTest 1.1 works with Scala 2.7,
and ScalaTest 1.2 with Scala 2.8. For a while we will support both 2.7 and 2.8 with new enhancements, with corresponding ScalaTest 1.1.x and 1.2.x releases.
At some point we'll bump up to 1.3 and only support Scala 2.8 and beyond.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The main change from 1.0 to 1.1/1.2 is many changes to support Scala 2.8. Many of these changes went into both 1.1 and 1.2 codebases to
simplify supporting both codebases in future releases. Some changes went just to the 1.2 branch. None of these should be visible 
to users of ScalaTest. In other words, the ScalaTest API did not need to change between Scala 2.7 and Scala 2.8, only its implementation.</li>
<li>Added <code>dir</code> attribute to ScalaTest ant task.</li>
<li>Renamed XML reporter to <code>junitxml</code> in the ScalaTest ant task.</li>
<li>Made <code>Tag</code> a concrete class (in earlier releases it was abstract), and added a <code>Tag</code> companion object with an <code>apply</code> method. The
abstract <code>Tag</code> class enabled users to define tags with <code>object SlowTest extends Tag("SlowTest")</code>. This enhancements allows
tags to also be created on the fly, for example, with <code>Tag("SlowTest")</code>.</li>
<li>Added <code>ScalaTestFramework</code> to support sbt.</li>
<li>Fixed "smiley-face" bug in XML reporter, an extra few characters that caused the XML to be invalid.</li>
<li>When running failed or ignored tests in WordSpec, print the "should" verb in the GUI report, which was missing.</li>
</ul>
